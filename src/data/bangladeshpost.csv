63,Move to halve road accidents by 2030,"This announcement came at a virtual meeting on Saturday while signing a memorandum of understanding at an event titled “Road Safety Collaboration: Reducing Road Fatalities 50 percent by 2030.”The World Bank and BRAC signed a Memorandum of Understanding to engage the organizations in a collaborative move to improve road safety in Bangladesh that needs to make a multi-sectoral effort involving law enforcement, the issue of driving licenses, engineering, awareness raising and post-accident trauma care.At an online event on the day, Obaidul Quader, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, inaugurated the program under this partnership.The event also launched a Road Safety Awareness Campaign along the 48 KM Jessore-Jhenaidah corridor as part of the partnership. The campaign will complement the World Bank supported WeCARE project, which was approved in June 2020 and aims to upgrade the existing two-lane highway, Bhomra-Satkhira-Navaron, and Jahore-Jhenaidah to a safer four-lane highway. BRAC and the World Bank will partner together to promote safety for women in public transport systems and conduct training and skills building for drivers, including women drivers. BRAC’s driving school’s initiative ‘women behind the wheels’ trained so far about 214 women as professional drivers.Globally, about 1.35 million people die every year in road accidents. In Bangladesh, road crashes are the fourth leading cause of death of children aged between 5 and 14, and 67 percent of victims are within the 15-49 age group. In the event, Obaidul Quader praised the joined initiative by the World Bank and BRAC and said, ""Under the leadership of Honorable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh has taken actions to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of cutting the number of road traffic fatalities by half within the next decade.”With more awareness and safer behaviors by road users, training of drivers, and better roads, Bangladesh is taking a comprehensive approach for ensuring road safety, he mentioned.He also assured that his ministry will provide full support regarding the training and employment of female drivers.Dandan Chen, acting country director for Bangladesh and Bhutan, said, “Road safety has become an economic and development priority for any country.” She said “We are proud to be part of the government’s commitment to better road safety through a National Road Safety Program.” “Our partnership with BRAC will reinforce the support to the program   for improving road safety in both rural and urban areas in Bangladesh,” she added. The collaboration will support exchange of knowledge and raise awareness among stakeholders to reduce fatalities and injuries from road accidents. This will help the country adopt interventions based on the Safe-System Approach, including safe roads and safe behaviors, as recommended globally. Since 2011, under BRAC’s community road safety awareness program, over 1.2 million people have received training on the safe use of roads. In addition, 5,451 schoolteachers and 498,000 school children have received special awareness training on road safety.Asif Saleh, Executive Director of BRAC, said on the occasion, “I believe this joint initiative between BRAC and the World Bank will be a big step forward to take the road safety system in the project area to a new level. With the support of the government of Bangladesh and the World Bank, we aspire to take BRAC's community led road safety model across Bangladesh.”He said the government, development partners, non-government organizations and most importantly the citizens need to work together like this in finding more comprehensive long term systemic solutions to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of reducing traffic fatalities by 50 percent.Ahmed Najmul Hussain, director of BRAC Road Safety Programme, said, “I believe that undertaking more such community-driven awareness initiatives for the other highways of the country such as the one to be implemented under this MoU along the Jessore-Jhenaidah highway will substantially help reduce the number of road crashes.”"

88,Deaths from road accidents continue  ,"On Friday, we saw the tragic death of Reshma Nahar Ratna, a school-teacher and an aspiring mountaineer, who was run over and crushed under the wheels of a microbus as she was cycling on the streets of Dhaka. Reckless driving was possibly the reason behind this tragedy. If we scrutinize the way road accidents are taking place in Bangladesh, we can say that most of the road safety measures taken over the last few years have gone in vein. Every time the gravity of road safety issues gets intensified when any student dies of road accident. After every incident of road crash we hear pledges from the BRTA, police, and other transport authorities. But all fade away with the passage of time, which is why the procession of deaths on the roads never stops.Unfit vehicles should not be allowed on the roads and campaigns must be conducted to raise awareness of traffic rules.Transportation experts blame unfit vehicles, unskilled drivers and reckless driving as the core reasons behind the staggering number of road accidents. Many bus owners recruit drivers considering personal relationship and recommendations of known people without properly examining their driving skill. What is more saddening is that a number of unscrupulous BRTA officials provide licence to the unskilled drivers and fitness certificates to the unfit vehicles without any test. As a result, a large number of unskilled drivers get chance to ply their vehicles on roads illegally. When the authorities concerned cannot maintain integrity in terms of giving certificates to drivers and vehicles, it is not pragmatic indeed to expect those drivers who buy licence through unfair means will maintain discipline on the roads. Too many lives are being lost on our roads every day, and it’s time the government put all-out efforts to bring some order to the road. It is high time that Bangladesh took stern actions against reckless driving. Also, in order to ensure road safety for all, the design and quality of the roads and highways must be improved; unfit vehicles should not be allowed on the roads and campaigns must be conducted to raise awareness of traffic rules."

223,Road accident fatalities continue unabated ,"Scrutinizing the way road accident took place in Bangladesh during this Eid-ul-Adha, one can say that most of the road safety measures taken over the last couple of year have gone in vein. Every time the gravity of road safety issues gets intensified when any student dies of road accident. Protesters blocking roads and seeking the highest punishment of the perpetrators have become very common repercussions of any gruesome road accident. After every incident of road crash we hear pledges from the BRTA, police, and other transport authorities of taking effective measures. But all fade away within the circle of time which is why the procession of deaths on the roads never stops. Following the last year’s students movement, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina issued a five-point directive in June to prevent road accidents. A special committee was formed too on 4 September to prevent road accidents and develop traffic systems. But most of the decisions and recommendations have not been materialised. Moreover, the act passed last year to ensure punishment of the law violators has rendered ineffective too due to the protests of the transport owners and workers.Scrutinizing the way road accidents took place in Bangladesh during this Eid-ul-Adha, one can say that most of the road safety measures taken over the last couple of year have gone in veinRoad accidents are common phenomenon in every country around the world. What makes them different is that other countries punish the responsible ones, but the culprits are always at large here in Bangladesh. The Kolkata police too in India have arrested the driver of the vehicle that killed two Bangladeshis in Kolkata on Friday. Whom have the police detained so far here in connection with the road accidents during Eid that killed many people? Has any official of any organisation been brought to answer?It is high time that Bangladesh takes stern actions against reckless driving. In order to ensure road safety for all, the design and quality of the roads and highways must be improved; unfit vehicles should not be allowed on the roads and there should be mass awareness on traffic rules. Also in order to maintain discipline on roads, the idea of Black Box can play an effective role. It will not cost more than Tk 10 thousand but will definitely help monitor vehicular speed and other movements. Also there is a need to set up an adequate number of CCTV cameras which will help in investigation of accidents in city streets."
