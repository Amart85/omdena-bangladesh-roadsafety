# Machine Learning Models

This repository contains the machine learning models created by collaborators in this project. 
There are two types of models present in here.
- Time Series Models
- Natural Language processing Models

## Time Series Analysis:
A time series is a sequence of sequential data points that occur over a particular interval of time. A "metric", in this case, refers to the piece of data that is tracked at each increment of time. Normally, each point is a pair of two items; the moment the metric was measured and the value of that metric at that point of time.

In a time series, time is often the independent variable and the goal is usually to make a forecast for the future. Depending on the frequency of observations, a time series may typically be hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual. Sometimes, you might have seconds and minute-wise time series as wel
