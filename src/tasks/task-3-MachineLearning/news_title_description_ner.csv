35pc of accidents are on motorbikes,"There were 26 patients, injured in road accidents, in the corridor in front of the operating theatre of the National Orthopaedic Hospital and Rehabilitation Institute (Pangu Hospital) in the capital city last Saturday. Of these patients, 12 were injured in motorbike accidents. The hospital authorities say that a large percentage of the road injury cases are the victims of motorbike accidents nowadays. Persons researching on road accidents said that motorbike accidents are mainly caused by reckless speeding, attempts to overtake, repeated lane changes, violation of traffic rules and talking on the mobile phone while on the move. The number of deaths is also increasing due to low quality helmets or not wearing helmets at all. Pedestrians also fall victim to accidents due to reckless speed of motorbikes. Shamsul Alam, a member of the General Economics Department of the Planning Commission, was such a victim. He had an accident last Saturday evening while walking in the Crescent Lake area next to the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban. He told Prothom Alo that he was hit by a speeding motorcycle while crossing the road. His right leg was broken in the accident. At Pangu hospital The National Orthopaedic Hospital and Rehabilitation Institute, better known as Pangu hospital, is the largest institute in the country for the treatment of fractured bones. Its official name is name is National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedic Rehabilitation (NITOR). Inquiries at the hospital's emergency department revealed that 34 people have received treatment after being injured in road accidents till 1 pm on Saturday. Among them, 16 were the victims of motorcycle accidents. Some were driving the bikes, some were passengers riding pillion and some were pedestrians. According to the five registrar books of the emergency department, 2484 people received treatment at the hospital in the first 16 days of the new year. Of them, 585 were victims of road accidents. There is no mention of how many of them were the victims of motorbike accidents. However, Prof Abdul Gani Mollah, director of NITOR, told Prothom Alo that 35 per cent of the road accidents cases at NITOR are victims of motorcycle accidents. He said most of the patients come from outside the capital. In recent times, the number of people injured in motorcycle accidents while sharing rides is also increasing. University student Naimul Islam went to NITOR on Sunday with a fractured his arm. He frankly admitted that he had the accident due to over speeding while riding with a friend. He told Prothom Alo that his motorcycle was over-speeding and control on the sand on the road. Even the general motorcycle drivers are worried about reckless driving. Md Nayeem Hasan, who works for a private firm, returns his home to Mirpur from his office in Banani every night. He said that motorbikes and cars race each other. This has become a major cause of fear for the ordinary motorcyclists. How many vehicles, how many accidents? According to the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), the number of registered motorcycles in the country is more than 3.1 million, which is 68 per cent of the total vehicles. There are about 800,000 registered motorcycles in Dhaka alone. Outside of that a large part of the motorcycles are unregistered. According to the marketing companies, about 500,000 new motorcycles are sold in the country every year. The Accident Research Institute (ARI) of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology and the organisation for the advocacy of safe roads Nirapad Sarak Chai (Nischa) compile reports of accidents published in the media every year. According to Nishcha, there were 3232 road accidents in the country in 2020, of which 1,127 were motorcycle accidents. Of these, 29 per cent involved truck accidents and 22 per cent bus accidents. According to BUET's ARI, 336 people died in 288 motorcycle accidents in 2016. In 2020, the number of accidents raised to 1,008 and 1,097 people died in these accidents. A 2007 study by the World Health Organization (WHO) found that wearing a good quality helmet reduces the risk of serious injury in a motorcycle accident by 70 per cent. And the risk of death is reduced by 40 percent. Regarding the trend of not wearing a helmets outside the big cities, the Assistant Inspector General of Police (Media and Public Relations), Sohail Rana, said that action is being taken in accordance to the law for not wearing helmets. Various awareness programmes are also being arranged. Ride sharing has increased In Dhaka, motorbike ride sharing has increased exponentially in the last few years. Many people who are not even registered with ride-sharing companies, also carry passengers on their motorcycles. ARI conducted a survey of the riders and passengers of 450 ride sharing motorcycles in 2020. It revealed that 50 per cent of the passengers suffer from insecurity regarding the driving. According to another survey conducted by the same organisation, 30 per cent of the drivers wear very low quality helmets. In only 2 per cent of the cases, riders are given ‘full face’ helmets. According to ARI's observation, the competition of ride-sharing motorcycle riders and the tendency to race ahead are the main causes of accidents. On Sunday, Prothom Alo sent e-mails to the authorities of three ride sharing apps asking the number of accidents of their vehicles. Uber did not disclose the number of accidents, but answered the question. They said they pay Tk 200,000 for death and permanent disability in an accident and a maximum of Tk 100,000 for hospitalisation. Uber said they encourage the use of the best quality helmets. Pathao (ride sharing app) did not reply to the e-mail. However, Maliha Malek, the managing director of Shohoj dot com, told Prothom Alo over mobile phone that they did not have any reports of the their ride-sharing app bikes having any accident. What are the riders and sellers saying? A review by a multinational motorbike marketing company has revealed that overtaking is one of the major causes of motorcycle accidents. Apart from this, fatigue and rushing are also the main reasons for the accidents. Reckless driving of buses, trucks, ‘human hauler’ passenger vehicles and cars , sudden lane changes, sudden turning and lane changing of non-motorised vehicles, sudden potholes in the road, high or low covers of manholes, unmarked speed breakers, carelessness of pedestrians and sudden movement of animals on the road are also some big reasons behind road accidents. For example, Akash Iqbal (26) and his wife Maya Hazarika (25) were killed when a bus of Ajmeri Paribahan hit them on Airport Toad in the capital yesterday. Top two executives of the two companies told Prothom Alo that sales of the motorcycles as personal vehicles are increasing in developing countries. Motorcycle sales will also increase in Bangladesh like Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and India. Public-private initiatives are needed to reduce the number of accidents. They also said that there is no effective system of training the motorcyclists in the country. Awareness and training initiatives should be taken in combination with the private sector. People should be encouraged to buy high-tech motorcycles with a good security systems. Shah Mohammad Ashiqur Rahman, the chief financial officer of Honda Bangladesh Limited, said the number of accidents had increased in Japan once. Later they reduced it with various measures. He said Honda provides the driving license on behalf of the governments in many countries. They are also providing training in Bangladesh. Plastic bowls in the name of helmets Sajjadul Bari, Director (Standards) of Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI), told Prothom Alo yesterday that BSTI does not have the facility to check the quality of helmets at present.

"Road accidents kill 37,170 in 5 years: Report","Road accidents in Bangladesh is still one of the leading causes of deaths as 37,170 people were killed in 26,902 accidents across the country in the last five years, reports UNB.  Besides, 82,758 people were injured in these accidents, according to a report released by Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity (BJKS), a passenger welfare body, on Wednesday, marking the National Roads Safety Day on 22 October.  According to the report, 8,642 people were killed and 21,855 injured in 6,581 road accidents in 2015 alone.  In 2016, some 6,055 people were killed and 15,914 injured in 4,312 road accidents.   Besides, 7,397 people were killed and 16,193 injured in 4,979 accidents in 2,017 while 7,221 people were killed and 1,5466 were injured in 5514 accidents in 2018; and 7,855 people were killed and 13,330 injured in 5,516 accidents in 2019, the BJKS report said. However, the association claimed that many reports of road accidents are not published in newspapers. These figures show that the number of casualties in road accidents in Bangladesh is increasing due to reckless driving and dangerous overtaking, according to the report. BJKS says that the desired development of roads is not yet visible even after the enactment of the Road Transport Act-2018.  Traffic chaos, anarchy, random fare hike and harassment of passengers still remain the same as before. As a result, passenger suffering, traffic jams and road accidents are increasing day by day, the report added. Amid this chaotic situation on Bangladesh's roads, BJKS considers it inappropriate to observe the National Roads Safety Day. It said the road safety issue no longer be limited to just observing a particular day as there is a need for implementation of the election pledge of the government to ensure safe roads for people on an urgent basis.

Including the casualties on rail and waterways, the death toll stood at 317 while the number of injured is 370 from 238 accidents.  The samity observed that movement of private and light vehicles saw a remarkable increase as public transports were allowed to run on a limited scale amid the coronavirus pandemic, which finally led to an increase in accidents and deaths in private transports.  The water-routes witnessed 74 deaths, 39 injuries, and 17 missing cases during the period while the rail routes recorded a single death in four accidents.  Accidents related to motorcycles consist of 43.78 per cent of the total accidents while 52.23 per cent of the accidents involved heavy vehicles.  ""If these two kinds of accidents are avoided, 96.01 per cent of the total accidents can be controlled,"" the report added.

Road accidents kill 2329 in 6 months: SCRF report,"At least 2,329 people, including 291 women and 381 children, were killed and 4,361 others injured in 2,159 road accidents across the country in the first half of the current year, says a new report. It says the road accidents took place on various highways, national, inter-district and regional roads between 1 January and 30 June across the country. Shipping and Communication Reporters Forum (SCRF), a platform of journalists, prepared the report based on news published in 22 national dailies, 10 regional newspapers and eight news portals and news agencies. According to the report, 411 people, including 53 women and 71 children, lost lives and 725 others sustained injuries in 383 accidents in January. Some 401 accidents occurred in February where 415 people were killed and 884 others injured. Among the deceased, 58 were women and 62 children. In March, 386 people, including 46 women and 82 children, were killed and 820 others injured in 384 road crashes. Some 327 accidents occurred in April that claimed 340 lives and left 610 others injured. Among the deceased, 38 were women and 53 children. In May, 338 people, including 47 women and 44 children, lost lives and 504 others injured in 297 accidents. A total of 367 road crashes took place in June claiming the lives of 439 people and leaving 818 others injured. Among the deceased, 49 were women and 69 children. SCR Forum president Ashis Kumar Dey told UNB that the forum identified 10 major reasons behind the rise in road accidents in the country. The reasons are: dangerous race by drivers and reckless driving, contractual leasing out of vehicles to drivers or conductors on daily basis, employing drivers without having any license, lack of awareness among pedestrians and small vehicle drivers, especially motorcyclists, drivers’ tendency to overload and overtake violating traffic rules. Besides, driving for a long-time without any interval, lack of implementation of law to stop plying of unfit vehicles, violation of traffic rules on long routes, increase in motorcycles and three-wheelers on roads and highways, and carrying passengers and goods in locally-made motorised vehicles are found to be responsible for increasing the number of road accidents.","[('At least 2,329', 'CARDINAL'), ('291', 'CARDINAL'), ('381', 'CARDINAL'), ('4,361', 'CARDINAL'), ('2,159', 'CARDINAL'), ('the first half of the current year', 'DATE'), ('between 1 January and 30 June', 'DATE'), ('SCRF', 'ORG'), ('22', 'CARDINAL'), ('10', 'CARDINAL'), ('eight', 'CARDINAL'), ('411', 'CARDINAL'), ('53', 'CARDINAL'), ('71', 'CARDINAL'), ('725', 'CARDINAL'), ('383', 'CARDINAL'), ('January', 'DATE'), ('Some 401', 'CARDINAL'), ('February', 'DATE'), ('415', 'CARDINAL'), ('884', 'CARDINAL'), ('58', 'CARDINAL'), ('62', 'CARDINAL'), ('March', 'DATE'), ('386', 'CARDINAL'), ('46', 'CARDINAL'), ('82', 'CARDINAL'), ('820', 'CARDINAL'), ('384', 'CARDINAL'), ('Some 327', 'CARDINAL'), ('April', 'DATE'), ('340', 'CARDINAL'), ('610', 'CARDINAL'), ('38', 'CARDINAL'), ('53', 'CARDINAL'), ('May', 'DATE'), ('338', 'CARDINAL'), ('47', 'CARDINAL'), ('44', 'CARDINAL'), ('504', 'CARDINAL'), ('297', 'CARDINAL'), ('367', 'CARDINAL'), ('June', 'DATE'), ('439', 'CARDINAL'), ('818', 'CARDINAL'), ('49', 'CARDINAL'), ('69', 'CARDINAL'), ('SCR Forum', 'ORG'), ('Ashis Kumar Dey', 'PERSON'), ('UNB', 'ORG'), ('10', 'CARDINAL'), ('daily', 'DATE'), ('three', 'CARDINAL')]"

"25,526 killed in road accidents in 10 years: Quader","Road transport and bridges minister Obaidul Quader on Wednesday told Parliament that 25,526 people were killed and 19,763 others injured in road accidents in the country in the last 10 years, reports UNB. He came up with the statistics while responding to a question from BNP MP Harunur Rashid. ""A total of 25,526 people were killed and 19,763 others injured in road accidents between January 2009 and April 2019,"" the minister said. He, however, said his ministry is not the organisation concerned to keep the record of cases filed over road accidents. As per the statistics, 2,500 people were killed on an average every year in road accidents. In reply to a separate question from the BNP MP, Quader said police, Bangladesh Road Transport Authority and Accident Research Institute of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) are keeping record of road accidents and casualties in the prescribed forms. He said a road accident usually takes place for lack of awareness of road users, including pedestrians. Lack of drivers' skills, tendency to violate law, lack of proper enforcement of laws, technical glitches, over speed, overtaking and overload of vehicles are also among the main reasons behind road accidents.","[('Obaidul Quader', 'PERSON'), ('Wednesday', 'DATE'), ('Parliament', 'ORG'), ('25,526', 'CARDINAL'), ('19,763', 'CARDINAL'), ('the last 10 years', 'DATE'), ('UNB', 'ORG'), ('BNP', 'ORG'), ('Harunur Rashid', 'PERSON'), ('25,526', 'CARDINAL'), ('19,763', 'CARDINAL'), ('between January 2009 and April 2019', 'DATE'), ('2,500', 'CARDINAL'), ('BNP', 'ORG'), ('Quader', 'PERSON'), ('Bangladesh Road Transport Authority', 'ORG'), ('Accident Research Institute', 'ORG'), ('Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology', 'ORG'), ('BUET', 'ORG')]"

185 killed in 135 accidents during Eid journeys: Nirapad Sarak Chai,"As many as 185 people were killed and 355 wounded in 135 accidents across the country during the Eid journeys, said a report by Nirapad Sarak Chai (Nischa). Among these, 180 were killed and 344 wounded in 130 road accidents alone. The report was presented at a press conference of Nischa at the Maulana Akram Khan Hall of National Press Club on Saturday. Nischa observed the holidaymakers had to suffer a lot during Eid-ul-Azha this year. It also said people from the northern region suffered the most as the transports bound for the region were stuck on the roads for long. Road accidents increased along the Khulna and Jashore region too, Nischa added. There was hardly any traffic congestion at the districts on the eastern part of the country as three bridges along the Dhaka-Chattogram route were opened, it further stated. Nischa said holidaymakers had to face problems in collecting train tickets due to black marketing and technical problems to buy tickets online. It added railway passengers also suffered a lot due to the disruption in the train schedule. Nischa observes journeys on the waterways were more comfortable. Road accidents scenario have turned alarming, said Nischa advisor Aiyubur Rahman who was a former chairman of Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA). He pointed out that that the road management was monitored prior to the Eid, but it was not followed up after the occasion. Former BRTA chairman said the drivers turned reckless in absence of monitoring. He also lamented the plying of unfit vehicles. Nischa identified that the reckless driving is the main reason behind the road accidents. Nischa surveyed national dailies, online news portals, news agencies and TV reports between 10 and 18 August for preparing the report.","[('As many as 185', 'CARDINAL'), ('355', 'CARDINAL'), ('135', 'CARDINAL'), ('Eid', 'DATE'), ('Nirapad Sarak Chai', 'PERSON'), ('Nischa', 'PERSON'), ('180', 'CARDINAL'), ('344', 'CARDINAL'), ('130', 'CARDINAL'), ('Nischa', 'PERSON'), ('the Maulana Akram Khan Hall', 'FAC'), ('National Press Club', 'ORG'), ('Saturday', 'DATE'), ('Nischa', 'ORG'), ('Eid-ul-Azha', 'DATE'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('Khulna', 'GPE'), ('Jashore', 'GPE'), ('Nischa', 'ORG'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('Dhaka', 'GPE'), ('Nischa', 'ORG'), ('Nischa', 'ORG'), ('Nischa', 'ORG'), ('Aiyubur Rahman', 'PERSON'), ('Bangladesh Road Transport Authority', 'ORG'), ('BRTA', 'ORG'), ('Eid', 'DATE'), ('BRTA', 'ORG'), ('Nischa', 'ORG'), ('Nischa', 'ORG'), ('between 10 and 18 August', 'DATE')]"
Railway accidents kill at least 209 in 6 months: SCRF,"Lack of people's awareness and poor maintenance of level-crossings and railway bridges by the authorities concerned contributed to the rise in railway accidents across the country that claimed at least 209 lives in six months, says a new report. Shipping and Communication Reporters Forum (SCRF), a platform of journalists, prepared the report. SCRF president Ashis Kumar Dey told UNB on Friday that they prepared the report based on news published by 22 national dailies, 10 regional newspapers and eight news portals and news agencies. At least 209 people, including 47 women and 21 children, were killed and 146 others injured in 202 railway accidents between 1 January and 30 June this year. According to the report, 39 people, including 10 women and four children, lost their lives and eight others were injured in 39 accidents in January. Forty-six accidents occurred in February alone, in which 43 people were killed and 22 others injured. Among the deceased, 10 were women and four were children. In March, 38 people, including six women and four children, died and seven others were injured in 35 accidents. At least four people were killed and two others injured when a train hit a covered van at a level-crossing near Feni Railway Station on 21 March, the report said. Twenty-three accidents took place in April killing 26 people and injuring six. Among the deceased, four were women and three were children. Three people died after they fell off the roofs of running trains at Dhirasram Rail Station in Gazipur on 23 April and 24 April. In May, 30 people, including eight women and three children, were killed and three others injured in 30 accidents. Twenty-nine accidents took place in June, in which 33 people died and 100 others were injured. Among the deceased, nine were women and three were children. Five people were killed and 67 people injured when six coaches of Dhaka-bound 'Upaban Express' from Sylhet veered off the tracks at Baramchal in Kulaura upazila in Moulavi Bazar district on 23 June. Comparing railway accidents and road accidents, SCRF president Ashis Kumar Dey said railway accidents were fewer than of roads in the last six months. At least 2,329 people, including 291 women and 381 children, were killed and 4,361 others injured in 2,159 road accidents during the same period till 31 June of the current year, he said. The SCRF identified five major reasons behind the rise in railway accidents, he said. The reasons are the use of mobile phones by pedestrians while crossing rail tracks, lack of pedestrians' awareness, negligence of railway employees and poor maintenance of level-crossings, poor maintenance of rail tracks and rail bridges. Quoting media reports, Ashis Kumar said at least 13 rail bridges with 'Dead Stop' signs are being used over 179 kilometres on Sylhet-Akhaura route, leaving thousands of passengers vulnerable to accidents. Eight of these 'Dead Stops' are in an 18-km stretch from Sylhet to Mogla Bazar and five in 164-km area from Mogla Bazar to Akhaura Bridge. The authorities concerned have already issued 'Dead Stop' signs at rail bridges instructing trains to stop first before crossing it and then run at a speed of only five kilometres per hour, he added.","[('at least 209', 'CARDINAL'), ('six months', 'DATE'), ('SCRF', 'ORG'), ('SCRF', 'ORG'), ('Ashis Kumar Dey', 'PERSON'), ('UNB', 'ORG'), ('Friday', 'DATE'), ('22', 'CARDINAL'), ('10', 'CARDINAL'), ('eight', 'CARDINAL'), ('At least 209', 'CARDINAL'), ('47', 'CARDINAL'), ('21', 'CARDINAL'), ('146', 'CARDINAL'), ('202', 'CARDINAL'), ('between 1 January and 30 June this year', 'DATE'), ('39', 'CARDINAL'), ('10', 'CARDINAL'), ('four', 'CARDINAL'), ('eight', 'CARDINAL'), ('39', 'CARDINAL'), ('January', 'DATE'), ('Forty-six', 'CARDINAL'), ('February', 'DATE'), ('43', 'CARDINAL'), ('22', 'CARDINAL'), ('10', 'CARDINAL'), ('four', 'CARDINAL'), ('March', 'DATE'), ('38', 'CARDINAL'), ('six', 'CARDINAL'), ('four', 'CARDINAL'), ('seven', 'CARDINAL'), ('35', 'CARDINAL'), ('At least four', 'CARDINAL'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Feni Railway Station', 'FAC'), ('21 March', 'DATE'), ('Twenty-three', 'CARDINAL'), ('April', 'DATE'), ('26', 'CARDINAL'), ('six', 'CARDINAL'), ('four', 'CARDINAL'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('Three', 'CARDINAL'), ('Dhirasram Rail Station', 'FAC'), ('Gazipur', 'GPE'), ('23 April', 'DATE'), ('24 April', 'DATE'), ('May', 'DATE'), ('30', 'CARDINAL'), ('eight', 'CARDINAL'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('30', 'CARDINAL'), ('Twenty-nine', 'CARDINAL'), ('June', 'DATE'), ('33', 'CARDINAL'), ('100', 'CARDINAL'), ('nine', 'CARDINAL'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('Five', 'CARDINAL'), ('67', 'CARDINAL'), ('six', 'CARDINAL'), ('Dhaka', 'GPE'), (""Upaban Express'"", 'PRODUCT'), ('Sylhet', 'GPE'), ('Baramchal', 'GPE'), ('Kulaura', 'GPE'), ('Moulavi Bazar district', 'GPE'), ('23 June', 'DATE'), ('SCRF', 'ORG'), ('Ashis Kumar Dey', 'PERSON'), ('the last six months', 'DATE'), ('At least 2,329', 'CARDINAL'), ('291', 'CARDINAL'), ('381', 'CARDINAL'), ('4,361', 'CARDINAL'), ('2,159', 'CARDINAL'), ('the same period till 31 June of the current year', 'DATE'), ('SCRF', 'ORG'), ('five', 'CARDINAL'), ('Ashis Kumar', 'PERSON'), ('at least 13', 'CARDINAL'), ('179 kilometres', 'QUANTITY'), ('Sylhet', 'GPE'), ('thousands', 'CARDINAL'), ('Eight', 'CARDINAL'), ('18-km', 'QUANTITY'), ('Sylhet', 'GPE'), ('Mogla Bazar', 'GPE'), ('five', 'CARDINAL'), ('164-km', 'QUANTITY'), ('Mogla Bazar', 'GPE'), ('Akhaura Bridge', 'FAC'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('only five kilometres', 'QUANTITY')]"
Accidents kill 12 people per hour in Bangladesh,"Paban Majumder is disabled. He met with a road accident and underwent surgery on 30 June at the capital city’s National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedic Rehabilitation (commonly known as ‘pangu hospital’), where his right leg was removed from above the knee. Paban’s younger brother Madhab Majumder is looking after him. Madhab told Prothom Alo that around 10 in the morning of 9 June, Paban had been going to the market by motorbike in Hatia, Noakhali. He was hit by an ‘easy bike’ and was seriously injured. His right leg was broken. He was rushed to the Hatia upazila hospital and then later brought to a private hospital in Dhaka. He was finally brought to the government orthopaedic hospital. Madhab said he himself had been badly injured when he fell off a coconut tree a few years ago. His left arm was broken. They spent a lot on treatment but his arm is still crooked. He said even his two other brothers had met with accidents. One brother lost an eye in while operating a machine in a factory in Dhamrai in 2000. Another brother committed suicide in 2007. This family from south Hatia seems to reflect the state of accidents in Bangladesh. According to the last national survey on accidents brought out in 2016, it was revealed that 12 persons died in accidents and injuries per hour in Bangladesh. Every hour 2287 persons were injured. And among those seriously injured, every hour 28 were rendered disabled. The report, ‘Bangladesh Health and Accident Survey 2016’, was prepared by the health ministry’s non-infectious disease control programme and the non-government Centre for Injury Prevention and Research, Bangladesh (CIPRB). A summary of the report was published, but not the entire report. Prothom Alo recently managed to get a copy of the full report. Head of the CIPRB data management unit Md Abu Taleb, speaking to Prothom Alo, said, “Accidents, injuries or wounds are a serious public health problem. These have a deep impact on a family, the society and the state. The public only comes to know of a very small percentage of the accidents including road accidents, suicide and drowning. The actually picture is much worse and alarming.” The World Health Organisation lists 13 categories of accidents and injuries. These are suicide, road accidents, falling down, being cut with sharp implements, being injured by a falling object, bitten by an animal or insect, violence, drowning, injury from a machine or equipment, electric shock, accidental suffocation and accidental intake of poison. The survey collected information on all these issues. In the survey, 299,216 persons of 70,000 families in towns and villages of 16 districts of the country were interviewed. The survey covered the period from March to June 2016. They survey stated that every year over 108,000 died of various accidents. Of these, 45,000 were children under 18 years of age. The main causes of accidental death among all age groups were suicide, road accidents, drowning and falling. Suicide was more common among women. Meanwhile, over 20 million people are injured in accidents every year, of which 242,000 result in permanent disability. Endless parade of deaths According to the survey, around 109,000 people die of various accidents and injuries every year in the country. That means, 298 die every day or, 12 every hour. The elderly mostly die by falling down. The survey report says that every year over 45,000 children under 18 years of age die in the country, that means, 125 in a day. And 37 per cent of this age group die of drowning. Other main causes of death in this group are suicide, road accidents and electrification. Among adults dying in accidents, the main causes are suicide, road accidents and falling down. Every day 170 persons die of these three reasons. A similar survey was run in 2003. A comparison of the two surveys shows that in the case of under-18's, accidental deaths have increased other than in the case of drowning and animal bites. In 2003, every day there were 83 deaths. This is now 125. Deaths due to suicide, road accidents, electricity and falling, have increased. Information on injuries remain concealed Md Abu Taleb of CIPRB collected and analysed information in 2005 on accidents and injuries. He told Prothom Alo, “ Every day, every hour, somewhere in the country someone is in an accident. Sometimes it is because of one’s own fault, sometimes due to others’. Only a few of these incidents actually come to light.” The survey took into consideration the accidents or injuries for which a person had to take medical treatment or had to abstain from attending school or work. That reveals that over 20 million persons are injured in a year, that is, 2287 persons are injured on the roads, outdoors, at home and at the work place every hour. The most people are injured by falling. They fall from trees and high buildings, slip and fall on the streets, from buses, trains and rickshaws. They have to be treated for their injuries and their everyday life is disrupted. Every day over 16,000 people are injured in this manner. There has been no national level discussion on this issue. Road accidents have been discussed in recent times, but not all road accidents reach the media. The road accidents which make news are normally about accidents involving many persons being injured at one time or many persons of the same family being hurt or if a child or a student is injured. However, many more persons are injured in accidents but these incidents remain unknown. Over 3.4 million people are injured in accidents every year, that is, over 9000 a day. More people are injured by sharp implements than in road accidents. Around 12,500 persons are injured everyday by knives, cleavers, scythes, spades, shovels, blades and other sharp implements. That means over 4.5 million are injured in this manner every year. While a huge number of people receive injuries, 91.9 per cent of these accidents are of medium degree where they are treated for their injuries and released or miss just one day from school or work. Serious accidents constitute 5.4 per cent of the mishaps where the victims stay for 10 or less days at hospital, but do not require surgery. And 1.4 per cent of the people are seriously injured in accidents and are rendered permanently disabled. 661 disabled per day Every year 241,000 people become disabled due to accidents or injuries. That means 661 are disabled per day. The most injuries are occurred by falling from heights. For about four decades now, the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed (CRP) has been providing treatment and rehabilitation services for the paralysed. CRP executive director Md Shafiqul Islam told Prothom Alo, “Most of the patients who come here were paralysed after receiving serious injuries of the spine or back. According to our records, 40 per cent of the patients are injured when falling from heights. These include high trees, buildings, bridges and so on. Many patients come in the summer months when they fall from mango, lychee and jackfruit trees.” These people fall and are paralysed. Around 83,000 people are disabled in this manner. The next cause of disability is road accidents, with over 80,000 disabled in this manner every year. Consequences and the way ahead While presenting a research study on 26 May at the government’s planning division, Md Abu Taleb said, “Accidents have a deep impact on the family, close relatives and the society. Most parents speak of their children’s studies being hampered because of accidents.” Speaking to Prothom Alo, he said, when the only earning member of a family dies in an accident, the family become helpless. The children’s studies come to a halt. They may have dreamt of becoming a doctor, engineer, joining the police or anything, but they simply end up as child workers. The research findings are very similar with that of the survey conducted by the health ministry’s non-infectious disease control programme. This study on the impact and consequences of accidents was funded by the social science research council of the government’s planning division. Deputy secretary of the planning division Uttam Kumar Das told Prothom Alo, “I had no idea that the problems caused by accidents were so big, so serious. We will send the results of this study to various ministries. The data will also be used in drawing up national policies.” The survey report had several recommendations. It was said that accidents would have to be included on the priority list of the health sector and a national accident strategic paper would have to be prepared and implemented. Also, experiences of any positive initiatives to prevent accidents should also be shared. CIPRB and icddr,b have jointly been running a project called Anchal since 2006, aimed at preventing drowning in water. The project is being implemented in 10 upazilas of 7 districts. Executive director of CIPRB Fazlul Huq told Prothom Alo, “Child deaths due to drowning have fallen by 50 per cent in our work area. All accidents can be reduced if such effective initiatives are taken up.” * This piece appeared in the print edition of Prothom Alo and has been rewritten by Ayesha Kabir","[('Paban Majumder', 'PERSON'), ('30 June', 'DATE'), ('National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedic Rehabilitation', 'ORG'), ('Paban', 'PERSON'), ('Madhab Majumder', 'PERSON'), ('Madhab', 'PERSON'), ('Prothom Alo', 'ORG'), ('around 10 in the morning', 'TIME'), ('Paban', 'PERSON'), ('Hatia', 'GPE'), ('Noakhali', 'GPE'), ('Hatia', 'GPE'), ('Dhaka', 'GPE'), ('Madhab', 'PERSON'), ('a few years ago', 'DATE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('Dhamrai', 'GPE'), ('2000', 'DATE'), ('2007', 'DATE'), ('Hatia', 'GPE'), ('Bangladesh', 'GPE'), ('2016', 'DATE'), ('12', 'CARDINAL'), ('Bangladesh', 'GPE'), ('Every hour', 'TIME'), ('2287', 'CARDINAL'), ('every hour', 'TIME'), ('28', 'CARDINAL'), ('Bangladesh Health and Accident Survey 2016', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Centre for Injury Prevention and Research', 'ORG'), ('CIPRB', 'ORG'), ('Prothom Alo', 'PERSON'), ('CIPRB', 'ORG'), ('Md Abu Taleb', 'PERSON'), ('Prothom Alo', 'PERSON'), ('The World Health Organisation', 'ORG'), ('13', 'CARDINAL'), ('299,216', 'CARDINAL'), ('70,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('16', 'CARDINAL'), ('March to June 2016', 'DATE'), ('every year', 'DATE'), ('over 108,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('45,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('under 18 years of age', 'DATE'), ('over 20 million', 'CARDINAL'), ('every year', 'DATE'), ('242,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('around 109,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('every year', 'DATE'), ('298', 'CARDINAL'), ('every day', 'DATE'), ('12', 'CARDINAL'), ('every hour', 'TIME'), ('every year', 'DATE'), ('over 45,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('under 18 years of age', 'DATE'), ('125', 'CARDINAL'), ('37 per', 'PERCENT'), ('Every day', 'DATE'), ('170', 'CARDINAL'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('2003', 'DATE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('2003', 'DATE'), ('every day', 'DATE'), ('83', 'CARDINAL'), ('125', 'CARDINAL'), ('Md Abu Taleb', 'PERSON'), ('CIPRB', 'ORG'), ('2005', 'DATE'), ('Prothom Alo', 'PERSON'), ('Every day', 'DATE'), ('every hour', 'TIME'), ('over 20 million', 'CARDINAL'), ('a year', 'DATE'), ('2287', 'CARDINAL'), ('every hour', 'TIME'), ('Every day', 'DATE'), ('over 16,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('recent times', 'DATE'), ('Over 3.4 million', 'CARDINAL'), ('over 9000', 'CARDINAL'), ('Around 12,500', 'CARDINAL'), ('everyday', 'DATE'), ('over 4.5 million', 'CARDINAL'), ('every year', 'DATE'), ('91.9 per', 'PERCENT'), ('just one day', 'DATE'), ('5.4 per', 'PERCENT'), ('10 or less days', 'DATE'), ('1.4 per', 'PERCENT'), ('661', 'CARDINAL'), ('Every year', 'DATE'), ('241,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('661', 'CARDINAL'), ('about four decades', 'DATE'), ('the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed', 'ORG'), ('CRP', 'ORG'), ('CRP', 'ORG'), ('Md Shafiqul Islam', 'PERSON'), ('Prothom Alo', 'ORG'), ('40 per', 'PERCENT'), ('the summer months', 'DATE'), ('Around 83,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('over 80,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('every year', 'DATE'), ('26 May', 'DATE'), ('Md Abu Taleb', 'PERSON'), ('Prothom Alo', 'PERSON'), ('Uttam Kumar Das', 'PERSON'), ('Prothom Alo', 'ORG'), ('CIPRB', 'ORG'), ('icddr,b', 'ORG'), ('Anchal', 'ORG'), ('2006', 'DATE'), ('10', 'CARDINAL'), ('7', 'CARDINAL'), ('CIPRB', 'ORG'), ('Fazlul Huq', 'PERSON'), ('Prothom Alo', 'ORG'), ('50 per', 'PERCENT'), ('Prothom', 'ORG'), ('Ayesha Kabir', 'PERSON')]"

Death rules Dhaka roads,"Over the last one year, 297 persons were killed in road accidents in the capital city Dhaka. And around 38 per cent of these victims were pedestrians. There is no decrease in the number of deaths due to road accidents in the city. These figures were revealed by the Accident Research Institute (ARI) of the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). The ARI statistics were from 1 July 2018 to 1 July 2019. Of these deaths, 46 took place on the Airport Road alone. According to the institute’s report, 276 died of road accidents in 2017 in the city. When two students of Shaheed Ramiz Uddin Cantonment College, Diya Khanam Mim and Abdul Karim Rajib, were killed in a road accident while waiting for a bus on Airport Road a year ago, angry school, college and university students broke out in protest. They took up a movement, demanding safe roads. The Dhaka Metropolitan Police and other agencies of the government at the time spoke of various initiatives to address the situation. A year has passed since the movement, but those initiatives are yet to be fulfilled. Dhaka’s roads still see no discipline. During the safe road movement, hoodlums in helmets swooped down on the protesting students and assaulted them. Journalists were injured in these attacks too. The police turned a blind eye to these attacks carried out by activists of the government-backed student organisation. Instead, they filed 60 cases against a few hundred demonstrators and sent 99 to jail, 52 of whom were students. These students are out on bail now, but still have to appear in court. The police have submitted charge sheets in two of the 60 cases. Final reports for two of the cases were submitted, recommending release from charges. The other cases remain under investigation. Jahanara Huq, the mother of an accused student Zahidul Huq, told Prothom Alo on Sunday, the police picked up her son on false charges. He was even sent to jail. He has to appear in court every month now. He is under mental stress and his studies have been affected. She has no idea when he will be released from charges. Former law minister Shafiq Ahmed has said that it is very unfortunate that the investigations in these cases have still not been completed. He told Prothom Alo that if there was no evidence or proof, the charges against the students should be dropped as soon as possible. Deaths do not decrease Upon orders of the Supreme Court, an inquiry committee had been formed to look into the deaths of the two students of Shaheed Ramiz Uddin Cantonment College. The committee, headed by the director of BUET’s ARI, Mizanur Rahman, submitted its report to the court. The report maintained that the disorder in the public transport sector was responsible for the road accidents in Dhaka. Public transport had decreased, but the number of private cars was on a steady increase. Most of the bus routes were haphazard. The bus drivers were not given proper appointments, but hired on a daily basis. The bus owners collected their money from the drivers at the end of the day. The drivers were also under a lot of pressure, having to pay for the fuel and other miscellaneous costs. Associate professor of BUET’s Accident Research Institute, Md. Saifun Newaz, speaking to Prothom Alo, said that the safe road movement is over, but Dhaka’s road accidents continue. The public transport sector is still in chaos. There is no visible progress in reducing the incidence of road accidents. Deaths on Airport Road Records indicate that the highest number of road accident deaths in Dhaka city take place on the Airport Road. Over the past four years, 204 persons have died on this treacherous road. On 11 February this year, an 18-year-old boy was killed by a bus in front of the Joarshahara bus stand. Police officer Mofakkharul filed a case with the Khilkhet police station in this regard. Police inspector (investigations) of Khilkhet police station, Abul Bashar Muhammad Asaduzzaman, told Prothom Alo that bus and motorcycle drivers drove at reckless speeds. Pedestrians mostly failed to use the over-bridges to cross the streets. That was why the road accident deaths were not decreasing. It has been observed from various records that there are 23 particular sports near the Hazrat Shah Jalal International Airport that are prone to accidents. Additional commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP), Mofiz Uddin, informed Prothom Alo that there were many reasons that the deaths on Dhaka roads were not decreasing. However, he said, the police were taking all sorts of measures to reduce the number of deaths.Chairman of Nirapod Sarak Chai, actor Ilyas Kanchan, feels that the road accidents continue as the road transport act is not followed. Vehicles without fitness were plying the streets of Dhaka, he observed while talking to Prothom Alo. The drivers were driving recklessly, killing people. Order would have to be ensured in the public transport sector to reduce deaths on the roads. He called for stern application of the existing laws. * This report appeared in the print edition of Prothom Alo and has been rewritten in English by Ayesha Kabir","[('the last one year', 'DATE'), ('297', 'CARDINAL'), ('Dhaka', 'GPE'), ('around 38 per', 'PERCENT'), ('the Accident Research Institute', 'ORG'), ('ARI', 'ORG'), ('the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology', 'ORG'), ('BUET', 'ORG'), ('ARI', 'ORG'), ('from 1 July 2018', 'DATE'), ('1 July 2019', 'DATE'), ('46', 'CARDINAL'), ('the Airport Road', 'FAC'), ('276', 'CARDINAL'), ('2017', 'DATE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Shaheed Ramiz Uddin Cantonment College', 'ORG'), ('Diya Khanam Mim', 'PERSON'), ('Abdul Karim Rajib', 'PERSON'), ('Airport Road', 'FAC'), ('a year ago', 'DATE'), ('The Dhaka Metropolitan Police', 'ORG'), ('A year', 'DATE'), ('Dhaka', 'GPE'), ('60', 'CARDINAL'), ('a few hundred', 'CARDINAL'), ('99', 'CARDINAL'), ('52', 'CARDINAL'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('60', 'CARDINAL'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Jahanara Huq', 'PERSON'), ('Zahidul Huq', 'PERSON'), ('Prothom Alo', 'ORG'), ('Sunday', 'DATE'), ('every month', 'DATE'), ('Shafiq Ahmed', 'PERSON'), ('Prothom Alo', 'ORG'), ('the Supreme Court', 'ORG'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Shaheed Ramiz Uddin Cantonment College', 'ORG'), ('BUET', 'ORG'), ('ARI', 'ORG'), ('Mizanur Rahman', 'PERSON'), ('Dhaka', 'GPE'), ('daily', 'DATE'), ('the end of', 'TIME'), ('the day', 'DATE'), ('BUET', 'ORG'), ('Accident Research Institute', 'ORG'), ('Saifun Newaz', 'PERSON'), ('Prothom Alo', 'PERSON'), ('Dhaka', 'GPE'), ('Airport Road Records', 'FAC'), ('Dhaka', 'GPE'), ('the Airport Road', 'FAC'), ('the past four years', 'DATE'), ('204', 'CARDINAL'), ('11 February this year', 'DATE'), ('18-year-old', 'DATE'), ('Joarshahara', 'GPE'), ('Mofakkharul', 'PERSON'), ('Khilkhet', 'GPE'), ('Khilkhet', 'GPE'), ('Abul Bashar Muhammad Asaduzzaman', 'PERSON'), ('Prothom Alo', 'ORG'), ('23', 'CARDINAL'), ('the Hazrat Shah Jalal International Airport', 'FAC'), ('Dhaka Metropolitan Police', 'ORG'), ('DMP', 'ORG'), ('Mofiz Uddin', 'PERSON'), ('Prothom Alo', 'ORG'), ('Dhaka', 'GPE'), ('Nirapod Sarak Chai', 'PERSON'), ('Ilyas Kanchan', 'PERSON'), ('Dhaka', 'GPE'), ('Prothom Alo', 'ORG'), ('Prothom Alo', 'ORG'), ('English', 'LANGUAGE'), ('Ayesha Kabir', 'PERSON')]"

Illegal three-wheelers making highways more dangerous,"Illegal three-wheelers plying the Benapole-Jashore and Navaron-Satkhira highways are increasing risks of accidents in the area. Locals accused the highway police of turning a blind eye to the situation in exchange of bribes. Sometimes, police pretend to seize a couple of three-wheelers and file cases only to release them again in exchange of money, they alleged. Police, however, denied the charges. During a visit to the area, the UNB correspondent saw ‘Mahendra’ (locally-made battery-run three-wheelers) plying freely from Bagachara to Navaron-Satkhira intersection of Sharsha to Benapole on the Jashore-Benapole Highway. The Mahendras leave for Benapole and Bagachra every few minutes from a makeshift terminal at the Satkhira intersection. Apart from it, engine-driven three-wheelers and battery-operated vans, called locally as Nosimon and Korimon, are also plying the roads. More than a hundred illegal three-wheelers are operating on the Jhikorgachha-Laujani, Navaron-Nobinagar, Godkhali-Jhikorgachha and Beneali-Jhikorgachha routes. Accidents are taking place almost every day. Locals say the unpredictable movement of these vehicles is increasing the risk of big accidents. Some people who spoke to UNB alleged that the vehicles continue to operate by bribing the Navaron Highway Police. The monthly bribes range from Tk 450 to Tk 5,500 each. There was another allegation that a certain group take money from the drivers of these illegal vehicles letting them to use roads in the municipal area. Anisuzzaman, Administrative Officer of Jashore District Bus Owners Association, said they are facing financial loss because of the three-wheelers. “No action has been taken despite written petitions submitted to various administrative offices for stopping movement of these three-wheelers,” he said. Navaron Highway Police Outpost’s in-charge Tito Kumar Nath said they are trying their best to stop the three-wheelers from operating on the highways. “We’re also filing cases against these illegal vehicles,” he said, denying the allegations of taking bribes. Mohammad Farhad, ASP of Highway Police’s Jashore Circle, said more than 200 three-wheelers were seized in the last one month. “We’re conducting drives to get these vehicles off the highways,” he said. “Action will be taken against members of highway police if they violate the law (by accepting bribes and allowing the three-wheelers ply the highways).”","[('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('Benapole-Jashore', 'FAC'), ('Navaron-Satkhira', 'LOC'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNB', 'ORG'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('Bagachara', 'GPE'), ('Navaron-Satkhira', 'LOC'), ('Sharsha', 'GPE'), ('Benapole', 'GPE'), ('the Jashore-Benapole Highway', 'FAC'), ('Benapole', 'GPE'), ('Bagachra', 'GPE'), ('every few minutes', 'TIME'), ('Satkhira', 'LOC'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('Nosimon', 'PRODUCT'), ('Korimon', 'PRODUCT'), ('More than a hundred', 'CARDINAL'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('Jhikorgachha-Laujani', 'FAC'), ('Navaron-Nobinagar', 'FAC'), ('Godkhali-Jhikorgachha and', 'LOC'), ('Beneali-Jhikorgachha', 'LOC'), ('almost every day', 'DATE'), ('UNB', 'ORG'), ('the Navaron Highway Police', 'ORG'), ('monthly', 'DATE'), ('Tk 450', 'MONEY'), ('5,500', 'MONEY'), ('Anisuzzaman', 'PERSON'), ('Jashore District Bus Owners Association', 'ORG'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('Navaron Highway Police Outpost’s', 'ORG'), ('Tito Kumar Nath', 'PERSON'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('Mohammad Farhad', 'PERSON'), ('Highway Police’s', 'ORG'), ('Jashore Circle', 'GPE'), ('more than 200', 'CARDINAL'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('the last one month', 'DATE'), ('three', 'CARDINAL')]"

Surging road accidents,"Surging road accidents On May 20 at least 7 people were killed in separate road accidents in three districts, Brahmanbaria, Gopalganj and Munshiganj. Barely a month had passed, and at least ten more people were killed and dozens of others injured in separate road accidents in Dhaka, Bogura, Narsingdi, Bhola and Narayanganj on last Saturday. The apparent cause behind these accidents was poor and reckless driving. Needless to mention, the deteriorating state of our roads, in the midst of high Monsoon season, have only added misery to the fresh spate of accidents. However, according to the Road Safety Foundation (RSF), in January 2021 alone, as many as 484 people were killed and 673 injured in 427 road accidents across Bangladesh-a 25.58 percent rise year-on-year. At least 445 lives were lost in 340 road accidents in January last year.The point, however, the high death rate on Bangladesh roads is also because of a chronic lack of investment in systemic, targeted, and sustained road safety programmes. Additionally, most of the accidents occurring so frequently on our roads and highways are quite avoidable. What we are witnessing under the current circumstances, road accidents is fast spreading like a pandemic, adding woe to another pandemic, in our districts and high ways. However, The Road Safety Authority has recently drafted a new National Road Safety Action Plan for the years 2021-2024 - aiming to bring down number of fatalities and injuries resulting from road accidents by 25 percent by the year 2024 - and 50 percent by the year 2030. That said - it must be noted that this authority has already failed to deliver on its previous promises, which was to curb the number of road casualties by 50 percent by the year 2020.So far a total of 8 action plans have been drafted by the National Road Safety Council (NRSC) since 1997, but none of them have been able to reach their target. Although a new plan has been formulated, there has been no proper enquiry over why the previous ones have been so ineffective in their implementation. Unless the latest NRSC plan is stringently enforced, death on our roads would only keep mounting.Surprisingly enough, with or without a lockdown, road accidents are seemingly becoming unpreventable in today's Bangladesh. It is time for the government to act, and not simply look away as more and more innocent lives continue to be lost on our perilous roads. In conclusion, there is no point in having a law, if it is not going to be implemented, and it is the duty of the state to ensure that families of all road accident victims receive justice.

Road accidents galore,"Road accidents galore Given fewer number of vehicles plying our roads during the lockdown, it was expected road accidents would come down. Even though accidents have dropped down within the capital, but the same haven't happen in our districts and highways.Last Thursday, at least 7 people were killed in separate road accidents in three districts, Brahmanbaria, Gopalganj and Munshiganj. And the apparent cause behind these accidents was poor and reckless driving. Needless to mention, sad state of many roads have only added misery to the fresh spate of accidents. According to the Road Safety Foundation (RSF), in January 2021 alone, as many as 484 people were killed and 673 injured in 427 road accidents across Bangladesh-a 25.58 percent rise year-on-year. At least 445 lives were lost in 340 road accidents in January last year.There is even a more menacing current reality, at least 468 people were killed and 507 others injured in 432 road accidents across the country in the last month amid the nationwide lockdown. Given the state of vehicles plying on our roads, the degree of sense and awareness of traffic rules of drivers, their level of proficiency, and the wanton corruption that allows untrained drivers and unfit vehicles to run the roads-it is perhaps surprising that why more accidents do not occur.The point, however, the high death rate on Bangladesh roads is also because of a chronic lack of investment in systemic, targeted, and sustained road safety programmes. Additionally, most of the accidents that occur so frequently on our roads and highways are quite avoidable. What we are witnessing under the current circumstances is that the danger in roads is fast spreading like a virus in our districts and high ways. However, The Road Safety Authority has recently drafted a new National Road Safety Action Plan for the years 2021-2024 - aiming to bring down number of fatalities and injuries resulting from road accidents by 25 percent by the year 2024 - and 50 percent by the year 2030. That said - it must be noted that this authority has already failed to deliver on its previous promises, which was to curb the number of road casualties by 50 percent by the year 2020. So far a total of 8 action plans have been drafted by the National Road Safety Council (NRSC) since 1997, but none of them have been able to reach their target. Although a new plan has been formulated, there has been no proper enquiry over why the previous ones have been so ineffective in their implementation. Unless the latest NRSC plan is rigorously enforced, death on our roads would only keep mounting.

Initiative must be taken to prevent boat accident,"Initiative must be taken to prevent boat accidentWaterway is one of the popular means of communication in riverine Bangladesh. Recently a collision between a sand-carrying bulkhead and a speed boat in Madaripur killed 26 passengers. According to newspaper, there is no registration of both water vehicles. Hundreds of people die in launch accidents in Bangladesh every year. On April 4, a passenger launch sank in the Shitalakshya River after being hit by a cargo ship, killing 29 people. Often such launch accidents happen and many people lose their lives.There are various reasons behind launch accidents: overloading, incompetent drivers, mismanagement, faulty launch design, lack of supervision, corruption, political interference and negligence. Although there have been frequent launch sinking incidents in the country, we have not seen sufficient instance of punishment of the culprits. Laws to prevent launch accidents have not yet been enacted. A government ordinance of 1976 has been amended more than once but that is not enough.Launch accidents often occur due to lack of regular supervision. Earlier, the Ministry of Shipping had identified 9 reasons behind the loss of life in the launch accident on the river Buriganga and recommended 20 points to avoid such accidents in the future. These recommendations included stopping boat bathing near the Sadar Ghat, removing the ferry, mandating voice declarations, setting speed limits, lifting old-fashioned launches, stop selling extra tickets, and modernizing naval law by increasing penalties, ensuring life-saving life jackets and efficient drivers.According to government estimates, 35 per cent of Bangladesh's people travel waterways. Although launch accidents happen all the time, very little action has been taken against the culprits. According to a survey, there have been more than 400 river accidents in the last four decades and about 10,000 people have died. The main reason behind all these accidents was mismanagement. Of the hundreds of launches operating on the Dhaka-Barisal route, only 10 to 15 have licensed drivers and the rest are all inexperienced and incompetent. There are more than thirty thousand river vehicles in Bangladesh, big and small, and only 9000 of them have fitness certificates.The Department of Maritime Transport has 4/5 surveyors to test the fitness of the vessel and it is really difficult and arduous to check the fitness with this number of surveyors. In many cases the fitness of these vessels is given without inspection which is really terrifying. Most launches do not have enough modern equipment and do not have the technology they need to get bad weather news. Although GPS technology has been introduced in some launches, most launches still retain that old style and are defective.Radars are needed to avoid collisions with other launches or vessels, but launches do not have adequate radars. The law of 1976 provides for a maximum imprisonment of five years, a fine of 1 lakh taka and compensation of 5 lakh taka against the owner convicted of a launch accident. However, in most cases, the launch owners are released after paying a fine. There have been many launch accidents in the last four decades and there have been a lot of investigative committees but those investigation reports have not really come to light. A few reports of the inquiry committee have been published but no action has been taken to implement the recommendations made there.Twelve major accidents have taken place in Bangladesh in the last twenty years, killing about 1,500 people. On August 4, 2014, a launch with 250 passengers sank in river. According to a survey, 42% of launch accidents happens due to collisions on the river alone. More than 4,000 people have been killed in 570 launch accidents in 29 years, mainly due to incompetence of drivers and carelessness. Launch owners and operators behave recklessly as there is no provision for severe punishment.There have been several attempts to increase the punishment of the accused in the launch accident but that too has not seen the light. According to the survey, 42.70 per cent of accidents are due to collisions, 24.70 per cent are due to overcrowding, 23.6 per cent are due to hostile weather and 6.17 per cent are due to explosions and fires. Owners and drivers are reckless due to the lack of severe penalties. Negligence and corruption in investigations is high and this leads to frequent accidents.There is a shortage of manpower required to restore order and adequate supervision of the waterways. A large number of unfit launches are operating on the waterways at great risk and are often the victims of accidents. There is only one marine court in the country to handle the trial of naval accidents but there is also a complex of cases. There are many cargo ships without registration and fitness and sand carrier launch one of them. These sand-carrying trawlers are one of the causes of accidents. There is negligence of the officials concerned of BIWTA in this case.A launch is supposed to be run by a skilled master or driver of the prescribed grade but in most cases it is not followed. Sand and brick carrying trawlers and cargo are prohibited on the waterways at night but the rules are not followed. There is no Marine Magistrate to look after the irregular navigation of the drivers. The authorities concerned do not conduct regular mobile courts to maintain the riverways discipline.River police cannot take immediate action. None of the port officers were given the power to collect fines and punish. In the last four decades, 20,000 cases have been filed for naval accidents, but only 200 have been settled. Again there are not enough manpower and equipment that can quickly rescue people after an accident. There is no alternative to intensifying patrols for preventing launch accidents on waterways. It is possible to control accidents through proper management and proper supervision by strengthening river patrols.The writer is an assistant professor, BAF Shaheen College, Kurmitola, Dhaka Cantonmen ","[('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Bangladesh', 'GPE'), ('Madaripur', 'GPE'), ('26', 'CARDINAL'), ('Hundreds', 'CARDINAL'), ('Bangladesh', 'GPE'), ('every year', 'DATE'), ('April 4', 'DATE'), ('the Shitalakshya River', 'LOC'), ('29', 'CARDINAL'), ('1976', 'DATE'), ('the Ministry of Shipping', 'ORG'), ('9', 'CARDINAL'), ('Buriganga', 'LOC'), ('20', 'CARDINAL'), ('the Sadar Ghat', 'LOC'), ('35 per', 'PERCENT'), ('Bangladesh', 'GPE'), ('more than 400', 'CARDINAL'), ('the last four decades', 'DATE'), ('about 10,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('hundreds', 'CARDINAL'), ('Dhaka', 'GPE'), ('only 10', 'CARDINAL'), ('more than thirty thousand', 'CARDINAL'), ('Bangladesh', 'GPE'), ('only 9000', 'CARDINAL'), ('The Department of Maritime Transport', 'ORG'), ('4/5', 'CARDINAL'), ('1976', 'DATE'), ('five years', 'DATE'), ('1 lakh taka', 'MONEY'), ('5 lakh taka', 'MONEY'), ('the last four decades', 'DATE'), ('Twelve', 'CARDINAL'), ('Bangladesh', 'GPE'), ('the last twenty years', 'DATE'), ('about 1,500', 'CARDINAL'), ('August 4, 2014', 'DATE'), ('250', 'CARDINAL'), ('42%', 'PERCENT'), ('More than 4,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('570', 'CARDINAL'), ('29 years', 'DATE'), ('42.70 per', 'PERCENT'), ('24.70 per', 'PERCENT'), ('23.6 per', 'PERCENT'), ('6.17 per', 'PERCENT'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('BIWTA', 'ORG'), ('night', 'TIME'), ('the last four decades', 'DATE'), ('20,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('only 200', 'CARDINAL'), ('BAF Shaheen College', 'ORG'), ('Kurmitola', 'GPE'), ('Dhaka Cantonmen', 'GPE')]"

Despite moves govt fails to curb road accidents,"		Despite the government's initiatives it has failed to stop fatal road accidents across the country. The government has failed to prevent unauthorized vehicles, including Easy Bike (battery-run human haulers) and Nasimon (locally-made vehicles), from running on highways.The number of fatal accidents involving three-wheelers is increasing in rural areas as they run on highways side by side with speedy, bigger and stronger vehicles. Recently a deadly crash on the Dhaka-Rajshahi Highway left at least 17 people dead in Rajshahi. Eleven of whom were burnt to death after one of the vehicles caught fire last week. Of the accidents, the highest number of accidents (1127) happened involving motorcycles while the number of bus was 698, truck 931, car and jeeps 410 and the rest were other types of vehicles.The rate of bike accidents was 19 percent in 2019 while it rose by eight percentage points     to 27 percent last year.Ilias Kanchan, the Chairman of the road safety movement, revealed the information at his last press conferences citing the data of Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA). Ilias Kanchan said 17.53 lakh motorcycle licences were issued against 30.32 lakh registered bikes, meaning 12.79 bikers are riding without licence right under the nose of law enforcers.Although there is positive practice of using helmets in city areas, this practice is missing in the countryside, he said, adding that use of bikes by unlicensed and young bikers as well as political activists with no regard for the law are the main reasons behind the accidents.Talking while riding bikes are also a major reason behind accidents, he said. Imposing restriction on use of bikes by teens, and making training and licence mandatory for bikers is necessary for decreasing the number of accidents.Lack of public transports, infrastructure, skilled and professional drivers, proper planning and awareness among people has contributed to the situation, experts said.The number of fatal accidents involving motorbikes, particularly in the capital, is increasing due to ridesharing services, experts also said.The accident researcher said due to absence of service lanes and alternative transports slow-moving vehicles ran on highways and accidents occurred.  The authorities should introduce buses on highways for small distances to keep slow-moving vehicles off such roads.According to Dhaka Metropolitan Police additional commissioner (traffic) that their main target was to improve the mass transport system.""We are also trying to improve the existing bus system by fixing bus stoppages, introducing locked-door and air-conditioned buses,"" a police source said, adding, ""The number of private vehicles should be reduced and people should be encouraged to use buses.""Then the demand for motorcycles would also go down, he observed. ""We are trying our best to reduce the number of accidents and casualties,"" he added.According to BRTA statistics, the number of total registered motor vehicles in the capital last year was 14.93 lakh out of which around 46 percent was motorcycles.The total number of registered motorbikes in Dhaka was 46,764 in 2015, which increased to 53,738 in 2016, to 75,251 in 2017, to 1.07 lakh in 2018 to 1.21 lakh in 2019 and over 1.32 lakh in 2020.

Reasons and preventive measures to road accident,"Reasons and preventive measures to road accident In recent times, Bangladesh is experiencing an alarming increase of road accidents. Rapid increase of vehicle is causing massive fatalities leading to many social tragedies.  According to WHO, the economic cost of road accidents in developing countries like Bangladesh is 2-3per cent of GDP.  From different surveys and news reports we have learned that the casualties usually happen mostly in highways where some speedy vehicles rule the streets. Some vehicles do not follow any traffic rules and get involve in madly races. The reasons for rampant road accident in massive scales are as follows. 1. A high growth in urbanization and motorization can be identified as one of the factors leading to the higher number of road accidents. Unregulated  movement  of  non-motorized  vehicles  along  with motorized  vehicles on  the  same  route is  also  one of  the  major causes for road accidents.2. The  rapid  economic  growth,  increasing  disposable income  and  urbanization  are  raising  the  demands  for transportation  rapidly  in  developing  countries. As  a  result,  the numbers  of  vehicles  on  roads of  developing  countries  are also increasing  rapidly. 3. The heterogeneity of traffic exceeding the capacity, plying of modes with varying speed and manipulation time make the road links as well as intersections even more complicated. 4. Irresponsible driving, risky overtaking, fault in road design, unfit vehicles, unskilled drivers, continuously longer driving hours than their stipulated schedules, use of drug and alcohol, passengers and pedestrians' unawareness, use of mobile phones or headphone while driving vehicles, occupied footpath and poor enforcement of law for the road crashes are also the  major causes for road accidents.5. Sometimes massive movement of the teenage or unconscious students across the country, results the death of the students hit by the speedy bus. Therefore, road accident steals many lives of innocent children, men, and women while injuring countless others.6. Faulty road constructions, lack of political will, lack of proper implementation of traffic rules and lack of proper coordination between structural development authorities are also the dominant causes behind the road accidents.7. Narrow road structures cause vehicles to slip. There are potholes and cracks on the roads, uneven speed breakers (some without the paint marking them) and unhealthy competition between buses can cause vehicles to lose control and crash or hit other vehicles and people. 8. Geometric defects like substandard design road pattern, lack of soiling, muddy roads, exceeding damage in rainy season, lack of proper management in road network etc are the notable responsible issues causing road accidents. The traffic police department has a crucial role to play in identifying and holding accountable inattentive driving, speeding and unstable or overloaded vehicles. The following could also be executed:1. An important factor  in road  safety management is  the collection and  use  of  accurate  and  comprehensive  data  related  to  road accidents. The interpretation of those data is a pre- requisite for an accurate diagnosis of accident problems and taking curative measures.   2. The prevalence of underreporting is a common problem. Therefore incorporating modern technologies like  using  GIS  techniques  in  collection  and  recording  of  data  is necessary. 3. The main areas that need to be worked on thoroughly by the government are maintenance, repair and expansion of roads united with setting up dividers on national highways, cautioning signals for unsafe locations, disseminating information on driving and road safety to more than enough through media. Parts of highway from illegal occupants should also have to be released.Reasons and preventive measures to road accident 4. The passengers also have to play a role in ensuring road safety. While travelling in public transports, passengers should protest and stop speeding and reckless driving by bus and taxi drivers. Furthermore, passengers should, under no circumstances, be allowed to sit on the roofs of vehicles while travelling.5. As an owner of motor vehicles we should have to ensure genuine licenses of employed drivers along with proper training and responsibly. Road safety education especially for the children is also a good way to promote road safety.6. Transport companies must take care of their drivers by providing accommodation in a healthy environment and should also appoint two drivers for the long routes. 7. There are thousands of unregistered vehicles in Bangladesh which are frequently involved in accidents. There need to be routine checks of the vehicles before setting out for the road and the substandard vehicles should be banned.  8. It is necessary to build an individualized preventive approach in each location like level crossings, overpasses, and underpasses that is prone to causing road traffic accidents.9. For a long-term solution, increasing public awareness through evidence-informed strategies, increasing the level of traffic sagacity detailed enforcement of road traffic legislation and stricter punishments can improve road safety. Again, a nation-wide awareness campaign could be organized and implemented by the government in collaboration with development organizations. The campaign should be delivered to the public through print, television, radio, and online media so that a substantial portion of the population can be reached.Finally the government should monitor vehicles on roads and highways more strictly, take steps to rid or minimize corruption in the process of issuing drivers' licenses and for ensuring government cooperation, a separate unit should have to be formed under the Communication Ministry to assess the causes of road accidents and find solutions.Dr ATM Rezaul Hoque is a Professor, Department of Economics, Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University ","[('recent times', 'DATE'), ('Bangladesh', 'GPE'), ('WHO', 'ORG'), ('Bangladesh', 'GPE'), ('2-3per cent', 'PERCENT'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('3', 'CARDINAL'), ('4', 'CARDINAL'), ('8', 'CARDINAL'), ('2', 'CARDINAL'), ('3', 'CARDINAL'), ('4', 'CARDINAL'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('7', 'CARDINAL'), ('thousands', 'CARDINAL'), ('Bangladesh', 'GPE'), ('8', 'CARDINAL'), ('the Communication Ministry', 'ORG'), ('ATM Rezaul Hoque', 'PERSON'), ('Department of Economics', 'ORG'), ('Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University', 'ORG')]"

Avoidable train accidents return,"Avoidable train accidents returnAt least twelve people were killed and eight others injured when a train ran over a bus at Joypuhat's Puranapoil level crossing on Saturday morning. According to witnesses, it was learnt that the level crossing was kept opened at the time of the accident, and the two gatemen on duty were not only absent but went into hiding after the accident.Even though, it is easy to comprehend how the accident occurred but our question here - for how long such easy to avoid accidents would continue to occur?According to an estimate of a reputable safe road campaigning body, Nirapad Sarak Chai, at least 198 people were killed and 347 injured in 162 railway-related accidents last year. And according to Shipping and Communication Reporters Forum (SCRF), as many as 421 people were killed and 366 injured in 393 railway-related accidents in 2019. Though both estimates entered the public domain earlier this year, but the sheer discrepancy in numbers has puzzled us. However, the dreadful train accident in Brahmanbaria , taking place in  last year's November was a tragic reminder of the neglect with which our railway has been treated over the years. But the latest accident occurred at Joypurhat was simply a sheer act of negligence in duty. We believe, it is time for our rail authorities to place all its countrywide employees under the scanner - so to monitor and evaluate their professional aptitude coupled with due sense of responsibility. The Joypurhat accident is unacceptable on all counts, since it was easily avoidable. The irresponsible gatemen must be brought to book the earliest.The Bangladesh Railway has been practically functioning with a skeleton crew for too long. In fact, according to its last year's annual report, the organisation is being operated with only one-third of the required loco masters, stationmasters and guards. Moreover, many technical staff lacks the necessary training to carry out their responsibilities.That said - the need of the hours is to recruit more railway staff while building capacity of the existing workforce, so that human errors do not result in loss of human lives. Concurrently, we need to ensure proper maintenance of our existing and future rail infrastructures, in order to turn our railway into a safe and reliable mode of transport in the country.More than enough valuable lives have been snatched away because of easy to avoid accidents, drawing bitter lessons from the Joypurhat misfortune , one more similar accident should not be tolerated.

Competition is one of the causes of accident,"		Dear SirRoad accident is a much discussed topic in Bangladesh. Bus accident is more common all over the country since it is the main vehicle to transport.On April 3 last year, Rajib Hossain, a student of Titumir College, lost his hand when two buses collided in Karwan Bazar, later he died. Such bus accidents happen regularly but if no one dies, it is not an issue of discuss. The transport system in Dhaka city is a bit chaotic. The bus drivers move uncontrollably, recklessly.  The drivers drive taking high risk for more passengers. Tendency of competition is very among them. It is often seen that one bus competes with another bus. Drivers do such acts to carry more passengers. As a result, the number of road accidents is increasing and ordinary passengers are suffering from insecurity. The indifference of the authorities in this regard is also disappointing.Incompetent drivers, faulty vehicles and competitive attitude in the hope of making extra profit lead to horrific accidents. Therefore, such a competitive attitude should be avoided to ensure the safety of the common passengers. Besides, the authorities should be strict and responsible and at the same time raise public awareness.Mamun Hossain AgunDhaka College                                                                                	    ","[('Bangladesh', 'GPE'), ('April 3 last year', 'DATE'), ('Rajib Hossain', 'PERSON'), ('Titumir College', 'ORG'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Karwan Bazar', 'GPE'), ('Dhaka', 'GPE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Mamun Hossain AgunDhaka College', 'ORG')]"

Is stopping road accident impossible?,"		Dear SirRoad accident is a regular issue in the country. In addition to injuries, the number of deaths is also increasing. According to Road Safety, a non-governmental organization, there have been around 300 road accidents across the country in the last month. More than three hundred and fifty people, including 35 children and 64 women were killed. About three hundred and fifty people were injured.Road accidents are on the rise due unfit vehicles, reckless speed of buses, trucks and covered vans, incompetent drivers, lawlessness and competitive attitude. Besides, road chaos and unplanned renovation activities are no less responsible. In some cases, public unawareness is also the cause of accidents. After all, the lack of proper enforcement of customary law has not reduced road accidents. As a result, the death march on the road is getting longer every day.Passersby and vehicle drivers need to be more aware of the traffic laws. Simultaneously strict enforcement of traffic laws must be ensured. In addition to stopping the movement of faulty vehicles, it is important to increase the efficiency of the drivers. Roads should be widened and dividers should be constructed on highways.Abu FarukBandarban                                                                                	    ","[('Road Safety', 'ORG'), ('around 300', 'CARDINAL'), ('the last month', 'DATE'), ('More than three hundred and fifty', 'CARDINAL'), ('35', 'CARDINAL'), ('64', 'CARDINAL'), ('About three hundred and fifty', 'CARDINAL'), ('Abu FarukBandarban', 'PERSON')]"

Bacteria that eats metal discovered by accident after 100 years,"Bacteria that eats metal discovered by accident after 100 yearsScientists from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have discovered a kind of bacteria that eats metal. The bacteria have reportedly been suspected to exist for over a century but has not been proved.The tiny microbes were discovered by accident, as scientists were performing unrelated experiments with manganese, a mineral usually found in combination with iron. Dr. Jared Leadbetter, professor of environmental microbiology at Caltech, left a glass jar covered with the substance to soak in his office sink.He did not return to the office for several months while he was working off campus, but upon his return found the jar covered with a dark substance later found to be oxidised manganese. That compound was formed by the bacteria.Scientists had previously known that bacteria and fungi could oxidise manganese or strip it of electronics, but microbes that could use such actions to drive growth were yet to be discovered.""These are the first bacteria found to use manganese as their source of fuel,"" Leadbetter said. ""A wonderful aspect of microbes in nature is that they can metabolize seemingly unlikely materials, like metals, yielding energy useful to the cell.""""There is evidence that relatives of these creatures reside in groundwater, and a portion of Pasadena's drinking water is pumped from local aquifers,"" Leadbetter added, as reported by CNN.Groundwater is water present beneath the Earth's surface, located in cracks in soil, sand, and rocks. Bacteria can remove pollutants in water, through a process known as bioremediation, reducing the amount of manganese oxide in the same way that humans breathe air.Researchers can now better understand the chemistry of his phenomenon, which ""serves to supply the other microbes with what they need to perform reactions that we consider to be beneficial and desirable,"" Leadbetter said.Scientists also believe the discovery will better help them understand Earth's elemental cycles, and the way the metal has affected evolution on the planet. Manganese nodules are often found on the seafloor, and can be as large as grapefruits.Marine researchers on the HMS Challenger, in the 1870s, have been aware of their existence but unable to explain them. Recently, mining companies have planned to use these nodules as a source of rare metals. The findings were published in Nature.    -INDEPENDENT ","[('100 yearsScientists', 'DATE'), ('the California Institute of Technology', 'ORG'), ('Caltech', 'ORG'), ('over a century', 'DATE'), ('Jared Leadbetter', 'PERSON'), ('Caltech', 'ORG'), ('several months', 'DATE'), ('Leadbetter', 'PERSON'), ('Pasadena', 'GPE'), ('Leadbetter', 'PERSON'), ('Earth', 'LOC'), ('Leadbetter', 'PERSON'), ('Earth', 'LOC'), ('the HMS Challenger', 'PRODUCT'), ('the 1870s', 'DATE'), ('Nature', 'ORG')]"

Mad rush blamed for Monday’s launch accident,"		The passenger carrier small water vessel 'MV Morning Bird' went under water as it attempted to overtake the gigantic launch 'Mayur-2' near Shyambazar killing at least 30 people.Dhaka-bound 'MV Morning Bird' from Munshiganj was heading towards Sadarghat when the accident took place.Witnesses of the area said it was trying to overtake Mayur-2 resulting in the deadly capsize in the Buriganga River. The dead included eight women and three children. The witnesses and persons involved in the water transport sector claimed that it was the first accident for overtaking in and around Sadarghat.Unnecessary overtaking in haste caused the accident, said the witnesses. Rasu Miah Majhi, a witness to the accident, told this correspondent that 'MV Morning Bird' sank as     it attempted to overtake 'Mayur-2'. The launch was in a hurry to drop its passengers from Munshiganj to attend their offices or shops, he said.More than 100 passengers were aboard the 'MV Morning Bird' when it capsized in the river after it had been hit by the Mayur-2, he said. The Mayur-2 hit the back of the small water vessel. Among the passengers, around 50 people managed to swim ashore with the help of locals and the rests lost lives.The Fire Service authorities said 30 bodies had been recovered from the sunken launch and sent to the Sir Salimullah Medical College Mitford Hospital. Launch owner Rasel Miah and Master Mohammad Badal Mia told this correspondent that many private employees and businessmen come to Dhaka from Munshiganj every day. As most of the private employees travel in those vessels in the morning, the masters normally try to drop them quickly so that they can attend offices in time.The driver of 'Morning Bird' might have tried to reach the wharf quickly overtaking Mayur-2, they added. Mohammad Badal Mia, the In-Charge of 'Jamal-9', said usually small launches carry a large number of officials and employees and small traders. They come from different adjacent places of Dhaka for work. That is why the drivers of these launches try to reach Dhaka very fast, he added.About the accident on Monday Mohammad Badal Mia said although the Mayur-2 was at low speed it was not possible for it to stop it immediately. It would have been possible to avoid the accident if Mayur-2 had had some more time, he observed.However, Badal Mia noted that larger water vessels should give space to smaller ones if the small ones move closer to larger ones. Meanwhile, the Shipping Ministry has formed a seven-member inquiry committee with Joint Secretary (Development) of the Ministry of Shipping Md Rafiqul Islam Khan as the Convener.

Perilous road accidents seems unstoppable,"Perilous road accidents seems unstoppable Despite nonstop campaigns carried out by various bodies to raise awareness about safe driving on the roads, there seems to be no respite from accidents. On average, 24 people die every day across the country, according to Jatri Kalyan Samity, a passenger welfare platform. The platform obtained the data by following daily media reports. On the other hand, a survey by the Bangladesh Health Injury Survey (BHIS), 2016, said that on an average, 64 people die every day from injuries suffered in traffic accidents. However, the actual number of wounded is much higher since many incidents are not reported.Often deaths occurring in remote areas are either hushed up or the families of victims paid compensation to refrain from lodging a case. Thousands of people are dying every year and bringing down the number considerably seems like a challenge. Yet, we feel that if certain factors are taken into consideration with some laws enforced vigorously, accidents and unnecessary deaths can be prevented. A massive road safety movement was organised after two students were killed by racing buses on the capital's Airport Road last year, which led to the formulation of the Road Transport Act, 2018.Being implemented now, the new act keeps the provision for strict punishment and fines but focus has to be given to road using culture plagued by terrible habits. Reckless driving is still a cause for concern, especially by bus drivers who are in a ferocious competition to beat the rival bus company in attracting the most passengers. Within major cities, this passenger catching technique results in rash driving though placement of speed breakers has put a check on widespread risky driving. There are several other factors and the most worrying is the culture of not providing enough time to recuperate for long route drivers. Lured by a system to make the maximum profit by spending the least, owners of several coach services often deprive drivers of resting time. On the other hand, new and inexperienced drivers, given charge of passenger carrying vehicles or goods delivering trucks, make horrendous mistakes resulting in an unfortunate loss of lives.Overcrowding of passenger vehicles is a common cause for accidents within towns and cities and in these cases, traffic police need to be unyielding in handing out instant fines plus impound the vehicle in question if it appears to be unfit. Perhaps the government can think of an intense two year strategic drive, roping in development partners plus top business conglomerates.

Road accidents rose last year in Sirajganj,"		SIRAJGANJ, Jan 17: Compared to the previous years, road accidents registered a rise in 2019 in the district, according to official sources. The number of death toll has also increased.In 2019, a total of 72 road accidents happened killing 110 people and maiming over 200 against the previous year's 55 incidents claiming 85 lives and wounding 150. These accidents occurred in the district's upazila roads and highways. Reckless driving, unseen turning, ignoring traffic signal, over-loading and overtaking were the main reasons for these accidents, police sources said.Unofficial sources said the number of the accidents would be more. Many accidents were not registered with police station (PS), according to sources at Hatikumrul Highway and Bangabandhu Bridge West PSs.In the district, there are total 404 km roads including 126 km highways.In 2019, 46 accidents occurred on the highway killing 81 and injuring over 150. In the local roads, 26 accidents took place killing 29 and wounding over 50. Officer-in-Charge (OC) of Bangabandhu Bridge West PS Sayed Shahid Alam said, in the district's highways, accident and death are high. About 12,000 transports ply on the highway every day.Comparatively, the width of the highway is inadequate, he pointed out.According to him, desperate driving, overloading, overtaking and sleepiness of drivers are the main reasons for the increase in accidents.Hatikumrul PS OC Akhteruzzaman said, comparatively, accidents are more in highway.

What does the law say regarding fire accidents?,"What does the law say regarding fire accidents?Tragic fire incidents are caused due to lack of fire safety in the commercial buildings, residential buildings, hospitals, supermarkets, educational institutions and even the slum areas where the poorest sections of our society reside. People of all classes are now falling victim to the terrible fire caused by such lacking of safety measures and unawareness.In November 2012, a fire broke in the Tazreen fashions factory in Bangladesh where garment workers were trapped due to narrow or blocked fire escapes and at least 112 workers died.Very recently, we witnessed the fire tragedy in Chawkbazar, Banani F.R tower caused by the unbridled greed of the building owners where 70 people and 25 people died helplessly and most recently in DNCC Market and Mirpur Slum Area.Many people lost their last hope and many became gravely injured.At least 16,000 incidents of fire have occurred around the country in the last 10 years, killing 1,590 people. The Fire service data had shown that at least 468 fire incidents struck only in the Puran Dhaka area alone. To take preventive measures against such terrifying fire incidents there are a number of laws that have been enacted such as Building Construction Rules 1996, Bangladesh National Building Code 2006, The Fire Prevention and Extinction Act, 2003 and The Fire Prevention and Extinction Rules, 2014 which look so much better in statute books but have very little implementation in practice.Besides, there are certain rules that are to be followed to build any building in Cities controlled by the authorities like RAJUK, CDA, RDA etc. But no one cares about the need to abide by the rules and regulations set in the statutes.Section 4 of the Fire Prevention and Extinction Act 2003 provides that if any person wants to use any building as warehouse or workshop, he shall have to take a license from the Directorate General of Fire Service and Civil Defense. Contravention of this section will result in imprisonment for 3 years or fine and the building along with goods kept in it shall be forfeited. Section 7 depicts, no structural design or layout of the multi-storied commercial building shall be approved or amended without the approval of the Directorate General of Fire Service and Civil Defence. Though all building owners collect the license in order to get an approval of their plan, there is no monitoring from the authority over the implementation of the relevant conditions. Moreover, RAJUK, City Corporation, Fire Service and Civil Defense are the related authorities to check on this issue but no authority is really concerned about their duties. Section 18 connotes that contravention of section 7 shall be dealt with imprisonment for 6 months or fine. Section 8 (3) directs every owner of the building to take precautions and other measures necessary for public safety. Also, Rule 22 of the Fire Prevention and Extinction Rules 2014 enumerates that owner of the building shall have to apply for an occupancy certificate of the building at the end of the construction. Rule 17(1) of the Building Construction Rules 1996 requires the establishment of the emergency exit gate and the installation of fire extinguisher machine or any other alternative arrangement along with fire alarms as an indication to leave the building. The Irony is, such public safety measures are barely seen in the buildings.To fence the curse of the fire incident, the government is obliged to take specific stricter approach by changing some of the provisions of existing laws and set up a new authoritative body through engaging non-governmental entities to regulate the building construction laws and rules, so that the safety measures are ensured and building code is maintained accordingly. Besides, the government must halt the corruption of the concerned authority while the technologically advanced equipment and latest training on putting out fire must be ensured among the firefighters and civil defence stations across the country. Moreover, we tend to discuss a lot for a few days when a tragic incident takes place, but any concrete action is never taken.

Judge observes drive for excessive profit behind road accident death,"		The judge in his observation in the Dia and Rajib Death Case said innocent people including students are losing their lives daily due to the whim of bus drivers and helpers. The collective conscience of the common people was stirred after the tragic death of two students of Shaheed Ramizuddin Cantonment College. On that day the general people and students came to the street demanding trial of the killers of the two students. Unfortunately, a vicious competition happened between the bus drivers just to meet their agreement with the bus owners of collecting more money.None is being spared from their evil clutches. The drivers should be more careful. For earning more profit they are not showing respect for other people's lives and are driving heavy vehicles taking light driving licences from the BRTA. It has become an addiction to kill people. It should be stopped. The traffic police need to be more responsible and stringently apply the law of the land. The owners should also be more restraint in earning profit. In his observation the judge referred to the role of journalists and said the case was filed under Section 304 of the penal code which stipulates the highest punishment of life term. There is no scope to give any harsher punishment than this. Journalists should understand the scope of the law and should not create confusion in society.

Technology can prevent road accident,"Technology can prevent road accidentIn 1886, when Karl Benz invented the automobile, people began to think about some automobile-related issues, especially issues related to the safety of cars and passengers.As the use of automobiles is increasing day by day, the number of road accident is increasing proportional to that, as a result, the death rate is rising, and those who survived, many of them become paralyzed and started living confined to four walls. Like other developed countries in the world, road accident is a major issue in Bangladesh. Apart from ensuring wider roads, trained drivers and slow driving, another concern can help preventing or reducing road accident and that is Technology. Vehicle or Automobile Safety Technology is a subject of advanced driver assistance systems or ADAS, and it has a vast area. As I said before that the development of vehicle safety technology started in the 19th century, just after the invention of the automobile. In that era, safety features of an automobile was known as safety glass, hydraulic brake, seat belt etc. Safety Technology saw a remarkable development in 1934, when General Motors started Crash Test for the first time. Crash Test is a test where the crashworthiness and sustainability and impact of crash/accident are assessed by occurring accidental simulation in cars and dummies. Later, Disc brake and Anti-Lock Braking system were invented. In the 20th century, road accident became one of the major reasons for death. As a result, apart from increasing awareness, technology became a big weapon for reducing and preventing road accidents. Since then, several companies started developing safety technologies. In 1995, Electronic Stability Control (ESC) was invented which was featured with powerful technology, though it wasn't used in every car. In 1999, Lane Departure Warning system was invented, it was another milestone of automobile safety technology. From the beginning of the 21st Century, most of the car manufacturing companies started implementing safety technology in their cars. In 2003, Honda and Toyota started implementing Autonomous Brake System.These all were not fully automated. In 2009, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) began studying to make frontal collision warning systems and lane departure warning systems. In 2012, a research by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety examined how particular features of crash-avoidance systems affected the number of claims under various forms of insurance coverage. This indicates that, two crash-avoidance features provide the biggest benefits, these are (a) autonomous braking that would brake on its own when the driver isn't concern to avoid a forward collision and (b) adaptive headlights that would shift the headlights in the direction, in which, the driver steers. At the circa 2012 stage of development, it's found from this research that lane departure system is not helpful and perhaps harmful. Periodically anti-car collision features are rapidly making their way into the new vehicle fleet. Many car companies like BMW, Audi, Mercedes- Benz , Ford, Toyota, Volvo developed vehicle collision avoidance system from 2003-2009, but not necessarily they are all time effective. Thus it is the main aim to ensure the safety of human life during the collision, the U.S National High Way Traffic Safety Administration has decided to make the pre-crash system mandatory for vehicles.Toyota has already given an official announcement that they are going to give this automated vehicles avoidance system in their Toyota & Lexus models by 2017. On the other hand, BMW has already introduced satisfactory & effective anti-car collision system on BMW 7series in 2012. Volvo Company has launched this system in Volvo FH by February 2013. Hope in near future, Apart from all the existing technologies, some other technologies will be introduced as well which will contribute to prevent road accidents.

Preventive measures must be adopted to reduce road accidents,"M A RAZZAQWe cannot avoid road accidents and, but at least we can try heart and soul to reduce the number of accidents as much as possible through awareness campaign among drivers and passengers. We appreciate the observance of National Road Safety Day - 2019 on Tuesday 22nd October in Dhaka and across the country. This is the third time, all the authorities responsible and concern came forward with an objective to build mass awareness to reduce rate of accidents. This time the slogan was: 'Jiboner agay jibika noy'. sarak durghatana ar noy' ( Livelihood is not before life, No more road accident ).Accident is an unfortunate incident that happens unexpectedly resulting injury or death. Accidents may occur in any of the three means of transportation - road, water and air. Among the three, road accident is undoubtedly the most common, frequent and a great cause of injury or death. Accident causes harm to a family, a society and the country.Only an accident survivor can realize the pain, the sufferings and the curse of the incident beside his or her family members, relatives and friends. Every moment, he is being chased by fear, tear, insomnia and a dreadful trauma of the mishap in his life. According to Bangladesh Passenger Welfare Organization, 7,221 people died of road accident in the year 2018 across the country and 15,446 people were injured in 5,514 road crashes throughout the year.The authorities concerned, government agencies have limitations to the issue except to convey deep condolence to media in some of the fatal accidents with assurance of fair justice to the victim or his family. Meantime, the bus owners are quite reluctant to extend any sort of humanitarian or remarkable financial assistance to the victim and his family, in case of severe injury or death. Even, they do not bother to pay a visit to the victim either in hospital or at home to console the members of the bereaved family.Instead, the bus owners remain busy finding umbrella to get lawful, judicial and political shelter whatever is fast and suitable for him, his transport and his driver. On the other hand, the transport workers remain busy in raising their voices, road- blockade, strikes in favour of their fellow-driver to prove his innocence and freed him from the hands of the law. Over and above, a strong and powerful syndicate is working behind this sector and so the result at the end of the day is as before - no change and no improvement. The BRTA - Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, the law enforcing agencies and the concerned authorities are somewhat indifferent and compromising in executing their responsibilities fairly and so this sector is merged in infinite corruption.One of the causes of road accident is the qualification of drivers- in terms of age, education, patience, proper training and tendency of competition.Moreover, extreme traffic congestion, poor road condition, unfit vehicles, trip based vehicle hiring, constant pressure of the vehicle owners for more daily deposits and relatively great freedom of drivers facilitated by the authorities concerned. The pedestrians also play role in an accident due to their negligence in terms of availing a bus, crossing the roads, using head phones, listening music, reading papers / books, attending mobile calls, gossiping, avoiding traffic signals, zebra crossing and foot over bridge etc.Transport sector is a very important and essential sector, and without this sector we cannot move. Reasons behind known or unknown, it is being neglected, lack in proper care and attention by the transport and concerned authorities since long. We cannot put an end to accidents but at least we can try heart and soul to reduce the rate of accidents by implementing pragmatic policy for the welfare of the drivers, transport workers, transport owners and awareness campaign.It is a matter of concern that most of the drivers and assistants are deprived of minimum accommodation, food, sanitation, affection and good behave from owners and even members of the law enforcing agencies. With a view to reducing accident, transport sector should come under intensive care of the government agencies and transport owners without any delay and debate. In our view, we propose as follows:01. Drivers and their assistants should be appointed on fixed salary and wages and service benefits, thus abandoning the traditional 'trip system' or no wok no pay system beside fixation of duty hours. 02. Medical, risk coverage and insurance policies, long term service benefits may be introduced to make the profession more responsible and attractive. 03. Minimum age, minimum education and maximum age limit should be introduced for drivers.04. Routine wise medical check-up with emphasis on eye sight, ear, brain, alcohol, addiction and sexually transmitted disease at least twice in a year should be made mandatory for every driver either on short or long routes.05. Training should be offered time to time to enrich their technical know-how beside personal, social and national responsibility. 06. Mass awareness in terms of walking on road, availing a transport should be build up by conducting related program, documentary film and campaigns in schools, colleges, universities and offices time to time. 07. A chapter consisting detail information about walking on roads, crossing roads, availing a transport and maintaining discipline on roads should be included in primary and secondary syllabus including practical demonstration.08. Insurance system for both the drivers and passengers should be introduced.09. Special tribunal should be set up in every district to deal the incidents of accident as fast as possible or within 90 - ninety working days.10. All kinds of strike, road blockade and any attempt to interrupt normal communication on roads by transport workers or owners should be declared banned for the sake of national interest and financial loss.We humbly request the honourable ministers and the political leaders and all related to this important and essential sector to formulate plan and policies to make it an attractive sector free of politics and unrest. We must take sincere initiative to reduce the rate of accidents as much as possible within our limitation of capability and limited resources. In general, people are not ready to listen or respect anyone unless and until there is an emotional impact and influence that causes them never to forget. We hope our leaders will take initiatives to touch people's heart as well as their heads to bring a radical change in this sector for the welfare of all related to this profession and this business, including the victims.Let we all believe in - No more accidents, no more injury and no more death because of our negligence.The writer is freelance contributor ","[('M A RAZZAQWe', 'PERSON'), ('National Road Safety Day', 'EVENT'), ('Tuesday 22nd October', 'DATE'), ('Dhaka', 'GPE'), ('third', 'ORDINAL'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('Every moment', 'TIME'), ('Bangladesh Passenger Welfare Organization', 'ORG'), ('7,221', 'CARDINAL'), ('the year 2018', 'DATE'), ('15,446', 'CARDINAL'), ('5,514', 'CARDINAL'), ('the year', 'DATE'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('daily', 'DATE'), ('duty hours', 'TIME'), ('02', 'CARDINAL'), ('03', 'CARDINAL'), ('06', 'CARDINAL'), ('07', 'CARDINAL'), ('90 - ninety working days.10', 'DATE')]"

PM’s appropriate call to reduce road accidents,"PM’s appropriate call to reduce road accidents The prime minister has struck the bull's eye by calling for alertness on everyone's part to prevent road accidents. It is indeed a good idea to introduce instructions on road safety right from the school levels. Awareness about rules of the road ought to be ingrained in the minds of children at an impressionable age so that observing the rules becomes a second nature.One couldn't agree more with the PM that the drivers alone are not responsible for accidents, but it is also true that most of the accidents are the results of either rash driving or disregard for the safety of other road-users, or caused by untrained drivers and faulty vehicles. Therefore, infringement of rules, whoever may be responsible, should be dealt with firmly and punishment should be proportional to the nature of the violation. However, the need of the minute is a set of contemporary laws that should be enforced vigorously. Given the heavy toll of life, not to speak of a large number of accident victims rendered physically invalid due to accidents, implementation of a new law does not brook any delay. Regrettably, the Road Safety Act-2018, formulated after student agitation last year for safer roads, seems to have been stalled, even after the president's approval. We are dismayed at the reported efforts to water down some provisions about the punishments, which in themselves are already inadequate. And this is being done under pressure from transport workers and owners. For example, punishment for killing by reckless driving carries a maximum sentence of 5 years whereas simple robbery and robbery on highways at night carries a maximum sentence of 10 and 14 years respectively.Such a soft stance on a grievous offence to start with, and now the attempt to take an even more lenient position on deaths on roads, may well compel other stakeholders to ask whether the administration is at all serious about reducing road accidents. Undue pressures should be resisted and the proposed Road Safety Act should be implemented without any procrastination.Finally, staying safe in the roads is a shared responsibility. That said - from drivers to commuters all must ensure their part of responsibility diligently. And alertness is a crucial element to stay safe. We must be aware and careful while commuting via roads.

Two Bangladeshis were killed and another injured after a speeding Jaguar vehicle jumped the traffic signal and hit another Mercedes car, before crashing into them under a police traffic post  in India’s Kolkata early Saturday.The deceased were identified as Kazi Mohammad Mainul Alam (36) and Farhana Islam Tania (28). The accident took place around 1:50 am, only a few metres from the Shakespeare Sarani police station, Hindustan Times reports. “Hearing the impact, cops came running out and took the injured to the hospital, where the two were declared dead,” said a police officer, who refused to be identified.An official of Bangladesh deputy high commission in Kolkata said that Kazi Mohammad, a resident of Jhinaidaha in Bangladesh was in Kolkata for eye treatment and Farhana Islam Tania used to work for Citibank. “We have not been able to speak to the third person, who, we gather, was released after treatment,” said the Bangladeshi official.Policemen say they have identified the owner of the Jaguar bearing registration number - WB20AU9797. “The vehicle belonged to a biryani outlet on Park Street. We have identified the owner. The culprit would be arrested shortly,” said an officer.The Jaguar was speeding at over 100 km per hour at the time of the accident. The absconding driver has been booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and rash driving along with some sections of the Motor Vehicles Act.According to the police, the occupants of the Mercedes were also injured but were released after initial treatment. Police officers did not reveal their identity.The bodies of the two victims who had come to Kolkata about two weeks ago are likely to be handed over on Saturday evening.“The bodies are at the morgue of the SSKM Hospital,” the Bangladeshi official said.Only on August 15 night, the son of Bharatiya Janata Party MP Roopa Ganguly was arrested for rash driving when his car hit a wall in Golf Garden area of south Kolkata. However, none was injured in that accident.Vehicles, speeding especially at night, are a headache for the city administration. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has been personally monitoring a road safety programme over the past two years.

No let up in road accident deaths,"		All government initiatives taken to curb road accidents across the country have, so far, failed. People are being killed almost every day, mostly pedestrians, and most accidents involve buses and human haulers that put the transport sector in a tailspin. According to BUET research at least 23 per cent of the road accidents in the country took place in city areas, of them, 74 per cent took place in Dhaka city alone.As many as 74 per cent of the accidents involved pedestrians, eight per cent rickshaws, three per cent motorcycles, two per cent by-cycles and 13 per cent others,  source said. According to the Accident Research Institute (ARI) at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), over 1,000 people died in road crashes in the first three months of this year.Using police records as reference, ARI data shows that on average, 3,000 road accidents take place in the country annually, killing around 2,700 people and injuring about 2,400 others. However, data from Bangladesh      Passengers Welfare Association (BPWA) places the number of overall casualties from road crashes even higher.  According to their statistics, as many as 7,397 people lost their lives in 4,979 road accidents throughout Bangladesh in 2017, while another 16,193 were injured. Their data further shows that 6,055 people died and 15,914 were injured in 4,312 accidents in 2016. In 2015, a total of 7,221 people have died in road accidents across the country in 2018, according to a report of the BPWA. A further 15,446 people were injured in a total of 5,514 road crashes throughout the year, the report added.Mozammel Haque Chowdhury, secretary general of the organization earlier said  the victims in 41.53 per cent of the reported cases died as a result of being run over by vehicles while 29.72 per cent of the deaths occurred in head-on collisions between vehicles.Around 16.18 per cent of the road crash casualties resulted from vehicles falling into ditches. The number of fatalities from road crashes in 2018 is lower than last year despite an increase in the number of reported accidents, according to the report.The report also found that 394 were killed in a total of 370 railway accidents while 248 people were injured in 2018.  Waterway accidents left 126 dead and 234 injured while 387 people were reported missing.Around 35 lakh motor vehicles are registered with Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) while the number of driving licences issued by the authorities is around 24.5 lakh.  ""Until we get enough trained drivers, the problem won't be solved,"" Khandaker Enayetullah, secretary general of Bangladesh Sarak Paribahan Malik Samity, said.At least 87 per cent buses and minibuses ply the roads in the capital recklessly in violation of traffic rules, creating anarchy in the public transport sector, said a passenger welfare platform citing its survey covering over one thousand vehicles.The mismanagement in the road transport sector, reckless driving and race among vehicles to pick passengers came to the fore recently after several passengers died or suffered grave injuries in avoidable accidents.The number of road accidents saw a marked rise in the last two years due to a growing number of motorcycles, says a new survey of Nirapad Sarak Chai (Nischa).""It is mainly the indiscipline in the sector. Most street accidents involving buses happen when someone is getting on or off a bus,"" Mozammel said.Issues identified by experts include undisciplined drivers, encroachments on roads, absence of adequate footpaths, misplaced foot over bridges and crossings and commuters ignoring existing overpasses.Above all, an unhealthy competition takes place among bus companies, leading to reckless and unlawful driving, speeding, bus ramming and a host of other bad practices that go virtually unchecked.Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) Additional Commissioner (traffic) in a recent said, ""Many drivers do not have valid licences.

2019 marks rising road accidents  ,"2019 marks rising road accidents  According to a report published by the non government organisation, Road Safety Foundation, at least 1,234 people were killed and 2,055 others injured in road, train and river way accidents across the country in the first three months of this year. It now appears, we are repeatedly failing to draw lessons from each and every avoidable ghastly death occurring in our roads. Our school, college and university students took to the streets twice in the last eight months--demanding safer roads and strict implementation of traffic laws but nothing is working.  In Bangladesh the poor are disproportionately affected with most of the victims being pedestrians, two wheelers and passenger of public transport. Fatalistic approach of Bangladeshi society towards accidents is one of the big safety issues. Accidents are perceived as casual events hence rarely investigated. A country where people are killed over a dispute of few hundred taka, accident casualties are taken as predetermined facts difficult to escape. This ignorance is a big challenge for road safety advocates and should be addressed on emergency basis.Reckless driving is still a cause for concern, especially by bus drivers who are in a ferocious competition to beat the rival bus company in attracting the most passengers. Within major cities, this passenger catching technique results in rash driving though placement of speed breakers has put a check on widespread risky driving. Our steamers and launches often carry way more passengers to that of their fixed capacity. The results are for all to see.There are several other factors and the most worrying is the culture of not providing enough time to recuperate for long route drivers. Lured by a system to make the maximum profit by spending the least, owners of several coach services often deprive drivers of resting time. On the other hand, new and inexperienced drivers, given charge of passenger carrying vehicles or goods delivering trucks, make horrendous mistakes resulting in an unfortunate loss of lives.  Regrettably, as a nation we are so inured by road accidents that these incidents are forgotten soon after and the causes remain unaddressed.The government can think of an intense two year strategic drive to minimize accident fatalities, roping in development partners plus top business conglomerates.Last of all, unskilled drivers, corruption in infrastructure development to unfit vehicles--major causes of all accidents are fairly well known by authorities concerned--the question, however, are they sincere and committed enough to address them?So far that sincere commitment is missing.

Have road accidents become unavoidable?,"Have road accidents become unavoidable?A university student was killed the day before yesterday as a bus ran him over while he was crossing a road using zebra crossing at the capital's Bashundhara Residential Area. The student was meritorious and an activist of road safety movement. The irony is that this killing happened when Dhaka Metropolitan Police was observing traffic week to bring the city roads under a discipline. Due to government failure to ensure road safety, students have not only abstained from attending classes but have also taken to the streets to restore traffic discipline. The students are continuing demonstration to press home their eight-point demand, under the banner of ""Safe Road Movement"", which are: freeing the transport sector of political influence, check necessary driving documents of all buses each month, bring irresponsible drivers under the purview of law and ban the commuting of all unfit vehicles. Countrywide students' agitation had erupted in the aftermath of the accidental deaths of two school students in last year's August. In fact, that should have served as the final wakeup call. Sadly, following countrywide protests, deaths continue to occur almost on a regular basis. Authorities concerned and the administration failed to bring the chaotic situation under control, and the same failure has been repeated this time too. For how long will this failure continue? Who would take the liability of the young ones being killed in our unsafe roads? The burning question right now, what are the causes that's making road accident unavoidable? It's evidently the collective failure caused by inefficient and unskilled drivers, transport workers, jay walkers to reckless driving of vehicles. We are unwilling to put blame on any particular quarter; rather it's time to reinstate traffic discipline with the active participation of all. However, if asked, what is one of the biggest failures of this government? The answer is short: failing miserably to ensure road safety.The government-that has shown its diehard commitment to fight terrorism effectively and efficiently, speed up the country's economy by taking its GDP growth to eight plus percent - continues to fail in deterring easily avoidable road accidents. Simultaneously, the government must prioritise this deadly predicament while restructuring the entire traffic control system. Our school, college, university students are not meant for ensuring road safety.   Need of the hour, we must all unite and work together to ensure road safety. Particularly, it's time to bring all unskilled bus and truck drivers under a closely guarded scanner. Let the untimed death of Abrar be the last in line.   ","[('the day before yesterday', 'DATE'), ('Bashundhara Residential Area', 'LOC'), ('Dhaka Metropolitan Police', 'ORG'), ('traffic week', 'DATE'), ('eight', 'CARDINAL'), ('each month', 'DATE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), (""last year's"", 'DATE'), ('August', 'DATE'), ('any particular quarter', 'DATE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('eight plus percent', 'PERCENT'), ('the hour', 'TIME'), ('Abrar', 'PERSON')]"

Scary statistics of road accident,"		Dear SirDespite different initiatives taken by the government, the road safety has not been ensured yet in Bangladesh. 4,439 people were killed and 7,425 others injured in 3,103 incidents of road crash last year, according to the Nirapad Sarak Chai. Illiterate drivers, faulty vehicles, weak traffic management system, carelessness of commuters, lack of political will and poor enforcement of laws continue to take a heavy toll on people according to scholars. Besides, the culprits for road accidents rarely face trial, and the impunity they enjoy is a major reason behind the continuation of road accidents. Trucks and covered vans were mainly responsible for those accidents. The number of road accidents decreased last year compared to 2017, but it was still not at the ""expected level"".Tens of thousands of students took to the streets for safe road following the killing of two college students in a road accident in the capital on July 29 last year, prompting the authorities to take some swift actions. The local administration and highway police are not playing due role to stop operation of such vehicles, allegedly. If the government implements its electoral manifesto regarding this issue sincerely, it is possible to cut road accident by 50 per cent by 2020. Governmental and nongovernmental organisations' joint efforts are needed to stop death in roads.Ashikur RahmanOver email                                                                                	    ","[('Bangladesh', 'GPE'), ('4,439', 'CARDINAL'), ('7,425', 'CARDINAL'), ('3,103', 'CARDINAL'), ('last year', 'DATE'), ('the Nirapad Sarak Chai', 'PERSON'), ('last year', 'DATE'), ('2017', 'DATE'), ('Tens of thousands', 'CARDINAL'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('July 29 last year', 'DATE'), ('50 per cent', 'PERCENT'), ('2020', 'DATE'), ('Ashikur RahmanOver', 'PERSON')]"

Alarming rise in road accidents despite safety measures,"		The number of road accidents is rising alarmingly across the country, despite government measures to bring safety to road and highway users.  Lack of proper supervision, misuse of administrative powers of some influential people and lack of public awareness were identified as the major reasons behind the high number of road crashes.Law enforcement agencies have been reporting death in 'road accidents' almost every day. At least 7 people were killed under trucks and other motorized vehicles across the country. At least 13 brick-kiln workers were killed and five others injured when a coal-laden truck overturned on the labour shed of a brick field beside Dhaka-Chattogram Highway at Narayanpur in Chouddagram upazila on Friday.A new road transport law has not been implemented. Meanwhile, only about 20 per cent traffic accident victims took their cases to court as the conviction rate was very low, although there is no official data to confirm this figure.The new law specifies guidelines on the minimum age and academic qualifications for drivers, number of vehicles on a particular route, working hours for drivers and helpers of buses, trucks, covered vans and other vehicles, compensation for road crash victims, emergency helpline, among others. At least 7,221 people have died in road accidents across the country in 2018, according to a report by the Bangladesh Passenger Welfare Organisation.  A further 15,446 people were injured in a total of 5,514 road accidents throughout the year, the report added.At least 27,000 people died in road accidents across the country in the past four years. This record shows 20 people die in road accidents in the country every day.Another 62,482 people were injured in the road accidents that occurred in four years, according to the organization and Accident Research Institute of BUET (Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology).A number of transportation experts believe that reckless drivers are the core reason behind the staggering number of road accidents in the country. ""Heavy traffic jam in the city makes the transport workers more reckless as they fail to make targeted number of trips because of traffic jam, making drivers more aggressive as gridlock cuts down their income,"" they added. A growing number of motorcycles is mainly responsible for the sudden rise in accidents, says a new survey of Nirapad Sarak Chai (Nischa). In 2016, the number of road accidents was 2,316, which grew to 3,349 in 2017. Last year 2018, the number of road accidents was around 3,200 -- the survey, based on reports published in mainstream newspapers. Ilias Kanchan, a road safety crusader, claimed that many underage bikers are careless on the road and speed recklessly, often causing accidents after losing control. ""That's why the number of accidents is on the rise,"" he said.He said a growing number of unskilled drivers of CNG-run auto-rickshaws, easy bikes and other three-wheelers also contribute to frequent road accidents.Kanchan said that a flawed transport system, mismanagement of owners, lack of monitoring, weak traffic management, lack of awareness among people, reckless speeding, poor road construction, lack of political will and lack of proper implementation of law are the other reasons behind road accidents.
